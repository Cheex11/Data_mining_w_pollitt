Total Calls, Unconnected, Leasing Opportunity
Like static reporting for demos?  That isn't my favorite solution.
Jack and I just got off a phone call.

I can guarentee that the 2.4% of calls is not sip 404s however I cannot guarentee that they are all 503s   Any sip 500 or 600 status code (and some 400s) could be considered congestion.

Asterisk is not just a sip server but really a generic phone API.

The problem with this though, is it generalizes beyond sip and treats the sip status codes like implementation details and hides them from the asterisk developer.

We have the data but it is from the packet captures we keep which ammounts to 100s of gigabytes of binary data in PCAP format.

Ideally we would be able to extract the sip callids and associated sip status codes from these files to produce a csv which we would then join up against the c_channels table to join up to the callmeasurement callid.

We could do this but it will take about a week to pull this data into a useful report.

I've told jack that he can hold off on his meeting with level3 because we won't be able to pull this data in time to provide specific complaints.

Before I pull this I'm going to try some things within asterisk to see if we can get a more granular look.  That way it'll be much easier to report on in the future.
Me too!
RSVP'd.
So you'd want to show Calls Connected and Leasing Opportunities?
David is the internet manager. He is using both. MPOC.
Can we accomplish that by making mock ups for you?
@Toni, that's the plan.  I didn't set an initial goal as I had no benchmark.  We do now, and goals for next week will be very specific, and a stretch from where we are.  We'll also plan to feather in some more intellectually interesting things after next week too.
Interesting note here: Rick Vidal, who was the previous GM at Lodi Toyota and switched to eLEAD partly because he likes us and our CRM integration, will be the new GM at Clovis Nissan. He'll probably switch Clovis Nissan to eLEAD.

The GM at Clovis Nissan will be the new GM of Lodi Toyota, they're already using Car Wars w/ eLEAD. Hopefully we'll keep it that way 
Added both of those changes and a blurb about our strategic consulting/advice. I have a call with Jeanne about this at 2pm and will post an update on this after that along with the document I am working on in google doc format. Thanks!
Will -- what is David's role at the dealership? Is he the only one using CW/SS?
That's fine. I understood this project would take time. 

Set production goals. Ie, the team needs to add 500 to the list by X day and then set a new production goal when that is met.
BOOOM!  Great work you guys.
Dossett Coppell -Dossett McKinney 	
@Toni, we're going to need the Interns to continue the SH Database project into next week.  Given their other commitments to training and other things, the progress at getting the Database built has been slower than I'd originally forecasted.  They're making much better progress with each passing day. <br>

Question, how long do we have them available?  <br>
Are there other commitments for their time beyond next week?  I have LOTS more that I'd like to get them involved in, e.g. add'l pre sales development type work.  

Let me know.  Thanks!  
Also sent an invite to Chaz and Tony (GSM at Grapevine)
Whenever you send an agreement to a Lincoln Property or a Stream Realty Property, make sure to include our RMIS vendor ID: 566951


Whenever you send an agreement to a Greystar Property, make sure to include our Compliance Depot Vendor ID 804609


Whenever you send an agreement to alliance residential, make sure to let them know we are enrolled in Net Vendor under "Century Interactive".


Jon, I believe we need a flat file. Also joe wanted to add in another field. He's currently traveling on a plane and should be able to respond a bit later. Thanks. 

We might be able to do a flat file again, will update after Joe's response 
Got it, Mike!
Hey Hayley,

The only dealership I've experienced trouble with since the onsites is Anchorage CDJR. David Kachadoorian works there and is constantly sending me incorrectly reviewed calls. 

The other dealerships were fairly quiet about any potential difficulties if there were any. But i don't have much to report on them. 
Jayah,

Can you please create something for this ASAP?

In order to avoid lengthy projects like the one below and in case of future PenTests, can everyone please make sure to include addtoken = "no" in your cflocation tags?

Ex. (cflocation url="logout.cfm?error=no_uid_all" addtoken = "no")

Unfortunately, there's not a way to default this tag to addtoken = "no" so it has to be manual.

Thanks!
JT & Ola - Can you guys handle this? Let me know if you need more hands to help!

I think Elizabeth created a travel plan and we have all confirmed our trip in the travel request. 
I also want to do an audit of the account that has been having issues with humanatic --AK Anchorage CDJR. Stockdale has been working with David Kashadoorian since he visited and he has had multiple issues with our platform the past couple of months. Where we currently are now with him is that he would never say anything good about our platform.

Lets further investigate what is going on here.
@Reid, thanks, MJ and I will just plan to see you over at the event in the am.  ~20 minutes to the airport tops at that time of day.

@MJ, I'll plan to get you at the Marriott Hotel at 715. I'll call when I'm 5 minutes away
Kristian sent me a few more examples earlier this week.  I walked him through the audit process and he hasn't sent once since.  I think he feels more in control of the process now.
Not sure, I heard about the news on a phone call
All under the login posted below. 

Ideally someone would just login.  Go to each account under that login and look at their numbers -- will likely need to be viewed in CM. 
Jon do we know who that GM was? Wondering if there has been turnover...

Remember we also have new features now too and we weren't engaging them ourselves.
Not yet.  He said he'd be happy to talk things through but we've played phone tag this week.  I'll have something by tomorrow.

On another note -- eLEAD still hasn't come out and said their actual rules for how they append calls today based on caller ID.  *Per the bi-weekly (2x/week) call this morning. 
Great -- lets definitely work around the dealerships schedule. 
Which accts?
@Lauren would you also post the dates of the lunch and learn events?  I'm trying to book some meetings while in Atlanta also and would like to coordinate my travel before I leave next week. 
CA Clovis Nissan will be staying with us.

Did we setup all Lithia stores with call summaries? I may have missed this.
I know there has been some issues with the stores in Alaska finding value in our product and poking holes in humanatic. I wanted to make sure they we were heavily engaging these stores and moving them towards finding value. Yesterday they also mentioned CallRevu, which makes me nervous to say the least.

I wanted to create this board so that we can document and discuss all our engagement and experiences with the Alaskan stores. If you have had past TC's with them, or have a current TC open, please update this board.

@Stockdale-- can you post some updates/vibes you got from the stores when you visited and since then? Can you also create a case for that call summaries issue we discussed earlier and tag it in here?


All accounts under the login cfesperman and pw cfesperman
For the attached accounts need to determine that they have the following numbers set up with the appropriate labeling --

Google +
Yelp 
Facebook

Media Type label value should be Social

And Department should be All

They should be local numbers.

Please create a google spreadsheet that indicates whether or not these numbers are present in the account.  Also if one is labeled Google local vs. Google + please notate the labeling difference as well. 
I'm confirming right now that they're dead set on a custom report vs a flat file
We could make a new report. We have a lot going on right now, so I don't know how quickly it can be done. 

Jayah or Jackie would have a better idea about a timeline.
<b>6/11</b> - Load remaining AZ mystery calls on recorders, create landing pages, put packages together and mail out. 
<br>
<b>6/11</b> - Start mystery calling NAA prospects who signed up for free calls. The list of prospects who signed up and the properties you'll need to call is attached. I will show you how to navigate it when you're ready to begin. 
<br>
<br>
@Alyssa - I created you a Hubspot account. Your username is alyssa@centuryinteractive.com. Hubspot should have sent you an email to set up your password!
This board will be used to keep track of/plan out projects Alyssa is working on with Lauren and I. Due dates should be kept in this board as well. 
Yeah. The main GM over there pretty much said "I've gotten what I needed to know from this tool  so I don't need it anymore"
On the call routing section, lead off with the primary value. People call a single State Farm number for dozens of different needs, and we efficiently get every caller connected to the perfect destination.

Also, write the path number as 45,000,000+ instead of 45 million to make it stand out more.
For the stores below that cancelled: "This was before we were allowed to reach out and before Lithia knew Car Wars was more than just pretty reporting (missed opp reports, lead box, etc)" [re their cancellation]

So I think they are still an opportunity to up-sell on Car Wars
When talking to Ian yesterday about the way we archive call summary data locally on dbo.humanatic, it donned on me that I may have missed something obvious. Are we posting hcat 143 data into the existing callmeasurement.dbo.xcall_short_summary table? That's the easiest solution and saves us from having to redo anything new in reporting.
How I understand it:

For Call Measurement 8c/min

For Car Wars 9.81c/min

For Car Wars + Service Setter 11.62c/min

I spoke to Randy on 6/8 and he said that they are not subsidizing any costs of our call tracking to the stores.
I'm going to press Mike and Kimeran for some specifics on their expansion plans. I want to make them uncomfortable for not holding up their end of the bargain here.
I have heard conflicting information about pricing from sources within our office. Let's clarify this!

Please confirm exactly what we are charging stores for each product and exactly what corporate is subsidizing, if anything.
Jacob, I am currently building the landing pages in the callmeasurement_v1/cw/lp

for rent buzz, the landing pages will  be in callmeasurement_v1/rb/lp, and so on for other hproducts.


Kyle completed the audit widget. I'll create the new two projects this morning:<br />
1. Integrate the widget into the hcat 143 template.<br />
2. Pull a call from the review path once it goes through the audit.

The second one is important to avoid confusion. After the reviewer does the 143 summary and then goes through the audit cycle, we don't want the normal contingency to then kick the call to hcat 7. We'll already have that data.
me 2
those are not the accurate dates any more it will be the following week.  Ironing out the details.
Jackie, think of it this way.  When we are doing sales pitches, or even account management, we like to tell a story.  "The average property is answering the phones right around 64% of the time.  When we install Rent Buzz, we see most properties jump from the 60s to the 70s.  So let's look at the benchmarks... here we see that all properties currently utilizing Rent Buzz are answering the phones at 55% of the time.... shit"

That is the problem we are running into.  We simply do not have enough properties on Rent Buzz to make meaningful explanations based on comparisons.  Our senior living accounts are bringing us down big time.  

I don't really care how we decide which static data to use.  I just want something consistent so I can intelligently sell.

I've had to move my flights a couple of times to accommodate Dallas meetings both today and tomorrow night.

I arrive this evening. I'm staying across the street from the conference center in some dude's extra room (seriously -- yay Airbnb). My flight tomorrow departs SFO at 1:00p, so I'll need to leave the event no later than 11:30a.
@Hayley Because of our schedule, I feel we should push the 16th back to the week of the 22. We can hit all the stores in one week, making one trip.
Classic Jong 
Spoke to 3 of the Dealers and two of them said that the next week would be way better.  So I told the third store we will be coming the following week.  The three cities are like a triangle in washington all at least 3 hours away from each other.  We have 2 in Spokane 1 in Tri Cities and 1 in Seattle.  
Phil is there a possibility i can get a detailed report of where the congestion occurs, LI,Toll Free, Termination, time of day, any thing you think might help pin point issue.  My meeting today is at 3:30 so anything you can provide will help.

Discussed with Konrad and asked if he had seen improvement since our move to Enterprise level with L3, of the top of his head he indicated a 95% inprovement in networt congestion.
Before I meet with SipX today I need to know that all of the 2.4% congestion calls are made up of 503  network congestion.
Get in my belly!
@Sarah,

Any word from John?
Yes, that would be ideal
I went ahead and added the link for DS worknote option. 

Do we need to have the option to select call summary only or other reviews only?
Yes it occurred after we migrated to the Enterprise level.   Those numbers I posted were from 5/31 to 6/1

Kevin I should be able to attend both.
CM repairs went well. I am finishing a couple indexes and Jashona is taking down the CM down messages
In light of the outbound click to call project.  Check out the press release Dealersocket put out yesterday.

Their data highlights the importance of outbound.
That's a question for Jacob.
I haven't heard from Kacia yet for another account to gather Medicaid data on.

We are unable to turn on PP PST without the client seeing the data. So we may not be able to do this.

They have not yet sent over their version of PST.

The main challenge I'm encountering is that Kacia does not move forward on any initiatives I am working on if there is any sort of reporting or support issue. She gets hung up on things like voice mail lines and recording greetings not working and won't work with me on projects until those issues are fixed.
The goal of this board is to make sure we have a plan moving forward to make sure we are actively engaging Lithia stores & preventing more stores from switching over to other call tracking providers.

1) We have begun our initial on-site visit planning in this <a href="http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/bproject_manage.cfm?pid=5990">bulletin board</a>. We will be hitting approximately 50 dealerships in June.

2) The dealerships that we will not be visiting in June, we are actively <a href="http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/bproject_manage.cfm?pid=5883">engaging on the phone</a>. Paige's team is conducting TC's for any stores that know about Car Wars and stores that are on Call Measurement.

3) For stores that we are not visiting, are on Car Wars and don't know about it, I will be engaging via the phone.

The main issue and threat with CallRevu recently is the dealerships lack of knowledge about Car Wars. Many stores don't realize that currently have us as a call tracking provider and many don't realize all that we are able to do.

We want to make sure all stores on Car Wars are finding value and actively using the platform and that all Call Measurement accounts are aware of what we can offer them with our call tracking platform.

<i>BB to discuss package pricing:</i>
Yessir!
Thanks Laura.

@Reid and MJ,

Looking forward to seeing both of you on Friday.<br>

I know that MJ is staying at the Marriott that's ~1 mile away.<br>

I can plan on picking you both up at ~7am, if you're at the same hotel.<br>

@Reid, LMK where you're staying if you'd like a lift in the am.<br>

The event starts at 730a with a buffet, Kickoff from the Kelsey folks @ 830, Reid's panel runs from 940-1040a

Link to updated Agenda included

Most interesting sessions from my perspective in the am are...

910 - Porch CMO<br>
940 - Reid's panel<br>
1100 - First "Networking break" <br>
1115 - Panel lead by the Home Advisor VP, Product Dev (The CEO and Pres from Home Advisor are listed as attendees of the show)<br>

@Reid, when is your flight out of SFO?  Trying to figure out if you're free for a quick meet up at 11am.

FYI, there's also a recently announced pre Show "meet up" party from 530-630p tomorrow, and an event afterwards at AT&T part, sponsored by Moon Valley Software (MJ, not sure if you're staying in SF on Friday night).  I cannot go to either of these events but you may want to.

The below dealerships that Jon posted were previously on Car Wars and cancelled. They are now on basic CM.

Feel free to still try to upsell them again.
Great find, Ben. 

Laura and Ross, this is ripe for it's own blog and a bunch of other stuff. 
Candidate project for 5:

We can utilize the current page, just need to make some updates for the ability to do it on the lskin level.

From the get go, we've had to manually update dbo.dnischange when a VF was needed in a schedule.
Lauren's is correct! 
Who has the correct list?  Are we going off of Sam or Lauren's? 

I'm fine with either, but I need to know so I can get travel booked for July.


1) Will campaigns be able to have multiple hproducts associated with it? The tool allows it, but the table structure does not. The ucomm_campaign table has one spot for hproductID

Yes, in case we do one that would fit in CW Essentials and CW Pro for example. We'll need to make it accommodate this. 

2) Do campaigns require a desired action? Desired actions are associated with campaigns, and I don't know how much sense it would make to have a campaign without a desired action. The tool allows you to not have a desired action when creating a new campaign, though.

No, they do not currently require one. They are optional to report on. We have some frequent desired actions, but we don't want to limit UCOMM to using one of them. 

3) Do all desired actions require a landing page URL? The tool removes the option to select an action when the 'No Landing Page' checkbox is checked, leading you to believe that actions require landing pages.

Yes, all UCOMM campaigns require landing pages, even the ones with desired actions. 
@Ian, I made you a case for that audit. That may be why we have so few calls going down these HCATs. 
@Hayley I confirmed with Nathan. I'll be available the week of June 22, but would not be able to travel until Monday, June 22 due to family in town. 
Nevermind, I just looked in Grapevine Ford again. Either they added groups back in, or our case to remove the extra phone code class didn't work properly. Grapevine Ford still has staff members in both. @Ian, we may need to audit that. 

We also may need to make it so users can't add the other group back in if they are already in one of the two. 
<ul> 
<li>Lithia Volkswagen of Des Moines
<br>5200 Merle Hay Rd
<br>Johnston IA 50131
 
<li>Audi Des Moines       
<br>5190 Merle Hay Rd
<br>Johnston IA 50131
 
<li>Acura of Johnston         
<br>5138 Merle Hay Rd
<br>Johnston IA 50131</li>
</ul>

These three already cancelled CW
High points attached.  Will continue to flesh out.  
As of right now we have scheduled the Compass event attendees and lunch & learn speaker/attendees through July (see Lauren's comment below). Lauren and I will get together next week to schedule the rest. 
Home Services ranks #1 on the list of industries that need call tracking. Something we knew but further proof and ammo to send to potential clients out there.
@Julie -- keep me posted with your availability the week of June 22.

What other stores are left to schedule with that are not below?
Yes they're all website calls.

One thing to note: they don't seem too interested in receiving flat files for now. Would we be able to make a new front end report for them?
I will give the Utah DealerSocket guys a buzz tomorrow.


As of have
<li>June 16- GM Ed- Mercedes</li>
<li> June 22- GM Anthony- Acura, Audi, VW, Used</li>
Here is a brief overview of what I would discuss - I'm planning to just open tabs for a few of the relevant pages for this beforehand so I can show them each one.

I appreciate any feedback you might have!
Yes we can do that. It will be all website calls, right?
This is so that we can coordinate and keep each other in the know instead of having to read to TCs.


Haeg


I have a few questions regarding the tool and the overall structure of UCOMM. 

1) Will campaigns be able to have multiple hproducts associated with it? The tool allows it, but the table structure does not. The ucomm_campaign table has one spot for hproductID

2) Do campaigns require a desired action? Desired actions are associated with campaigns, and I don't know how much sense it would make to have a campaign without a desired action. The tool allows you to not have a desired action when creating a new campaign, though.

3) Do all desired actions require a landing page URL? The tool removes the option to select an action when the 'No Landing Page' checkbox is checked, leading you to believe that actions require landing pages.  

These are all minor details and won't affect the progress of UCOMM. I just need to know before the code is finalized.
Dustin can you post an update please?
How is planning coming?
Remember -- if you schedule a set day and time with a store, send them a follow-up email AND a calendar invite.
Oh I was confused. That's what your project was. Just make sure you hit all of the CTAs. There are CTAs on the Learn pages too. 
Here are the remaining events:

June 24- Dallas: Mike H.<br>
July 15- Atlanta: Toni <br>
July 29- Chicago: Lindsay <br>
August 5- Pittsburg: Corey <br>
August 26- Santa Clara: Sarah S. <br>
September 9- St Louis: Sam T. <br>
September 16- Las Vegas: Tom<br>

Who is in charge of assigning our team for each city? I think there is some confusion on who will be attending each event outside of the speaker mentioned above.
@Jane, do you have projects to get the rentbuzz.com homepage to direct here from CTAs? Or will you be pointing to CRISP?
Dustin -- if you still want KC names to drop let us know.  We just want to give these guys the heads up -- (there are more)

Buick GMC Cadillac/KC
General Manager: Louis Bibler, Louis.bibler@hendrickauto.com 
Exec. GM R.J. Crites, rj.crites@hendrickauto.com 
BDC Manager - Emily Durrie -- emily.durrie@hendrickauto.com
Maybe we don't tease like 12 different pods, but we tease the Dealership Performance Report, Lead Box, Phone Skills Training, and Scoreboard. We'll make it overt that they are used to track inbound calls. 

Then I wonder if we tease these in both CW Outbound and Outbound Discovery, or start small and only tease CW Outbound in Outbound Discovery. Once they've gotten to CW Outbound, we tease inbound. 

Reid also suggested that we may make an outbound version of gaming to use in CW Outbound. 
PE and Reid - I just shared this with you so you can see it.
The webpage is being updated to reflect this completion: 
@Monica, I'm just concerned that we'll be presenting industry averages based on other companies' data. I'm not sure anything we find should be taken as the ultimate truth enough to put into our product. What is the industry average? I know we find a lot of (maybe even reliable) stats for marketing, but it worries me more to put them in reporting.

As for automatic processes, we now require sales people to assign groups as part of ConGen. 
Yes, you're right it does.  I'm not sure I saw your though process as to where that would go in the flow, but as I brainstormed it, I did end up in a similar place.
We'll get this in a queue for a project down the road. 
The developer Mike and I had the call with was pretty sharp.  Based on the code and requirements he thought they might be able to fit it in their July sprint.  I don't think we need to fire a bullet with Ben.

We'll just give them a friendly follow up recapping your visit to CA with the offer to plant some people in Utah.  They won't take us up on the offer for dev people, but it will push the envelope.

Great work Dustin!

I saw Anthony give a presentation at Digital Dealer with Rich Lucy.  He's a really sharp guy.  Anthony and Rich Lucy are very close.  Tom Taylor recently pitched Rich at his store in Utah.  If Tom can knock down Rich at Newby Buick GMC, then we probably have a good shot to get a referral.

Anthony uses VIN Solutions where they are based.  We have Hendrick and Berkshire Hathaway stores all around him, but our biggest referrals will come from VIN clients.  

Our biggest VIN clients are Jeff Wyler, Moreland Auto, Garber and Feldman.  

Kevin Wright is the director at Jeff Wyler and he's very active in the dealer community.  I'd be surprised if they don't know each other.
Bennett Boothe is the director at Moreland Auto and he is a solid reference.
Writing mine 
Discovery product
They are with VIN so also the largest ones from that CRM might help
Mike?

See last question. 
I just spoke to Anthony Bartoli from Bommarito Ford for a CW discovery TC.  He told me that he didn't see a reason to even try Car Wars because he talked to his friends and no one else was using us.   He asked me to compile a list of top selling cars clients that use us.  He is in Kansas City MO.  <br><br>
I told him that VT is our client which they are one of the largest car dealerships in the country and we are their call tracking provider
<br><br>
Can you help me compile a list to send to him??
Ok, got it!

Dan, the background activity behind you on the Hangout will effectively serve as your supporting visual aid.
Justin and Mike -- let me know when/if it's helpful for me to reach out to Ben. I'll stay out of the way unless you say otherwise.
Time...
Phil was the 2.4 % congestion rate aggregated before or after May 1, 2015?

We have been down the  path with LD resellers that have never performed, however I am meeting with SipXchange's owners tomorrow and will run this situation by them. 

I need to confirm that the 2.4% congestion figure was after we migrated to the Enterprise level with L3 in May.

Jian, how difficult would it be to add the options for DS?
Any news on this?
Yes, it's a year. I validated it on the website.
It did not list a duration so, a year would be my assumption.
Will I need to have a power point with my presentation since I'm set up via a hangout?

For an individual it's $165.00
396/year?
$396.00 for a 21-40 Employee company.
I think we absolutely should.  Does it cost anything?  


Councilman Griggs specifically stated that we should be a member to network with businesses as potential Lead Tag clients and to network with organizations for recruiting purposes.

1. How does Auto-trader feel about making a POD in our system and promoting only them for a tracking line?

I wouldn't say we're promoting them. We're showing how a popular lead source performs for sales leads. 

There's your non answer.
Would we consider getting a membership with the Oak Cliff Chamber of Commerce? Some solid networking benefits listed.
That's a solid group right there Thomas.  As discussed, keep being proactive in networking/ recruiting as opposed to just settling for applicants that come through via our website. 


Keep finding the Alex Martinez's, Tyree's, Myranda's and (insert many more names of our current and awesome agents).  
Offline convo with Keaton, success. 

@Jackie, can you remind me if anything to do with Group Associations was part of the automatic launch updates we're doing?

Keaton and I are proposing creating a static "Industry Avg" benchmark rather than have benchmarks dependent on our RB data sample. 
I wrote that in response, saying that now, we really shouldn't HAVE agents in both classes. Would you agree, Ian?
To clarify, we have already removed the extra phone code class from any agent in both CW and SS. We did it by looking at the inbound calls they handle.

I've also communicated to the accounts team and consultants that we did so, and that anyone making both types of calls will have to have two separate phone codes.

So it is a solution we are trying. Having said that, it's very possible that certain phone codes that now have only Car Wars Service (due to our case) are making sales calls. 
I only have like 3 jokes. So, if you know me, then be prepared for repeated jokes...
That last name first name validation piece is also done now.
No. It's RB Discovery Sign Up. The upgrade one is the one inside the product.
DS doesn't have an option. It's either ON or OFF. Elead has option. 

Of course we haven't add the link for DS yet.
Just an update on successful networking partnerships, and who we were able to recruit from these partnerships. 
<br>
<br>
1. Promise House - Shatara (Tyree) Jackson
<br>
2. Work Ready Texas - Gary Moon
<br>
3. CitySquare TRAC - Michelle Coffer
<br>
4. Friendship West - Rebecca Ayers
<br>
5. Brother Bill's Helping Hand
<br>
6. SERVE West Dallas
<br>
7. Oak Cliff Chamber of Commerce 
Here's the project to build a landing page template and whip out the first 4 landing pages that marketing wrote for our first campaigns.

Have you grabbed the phone codes that are tagged for both classes and had someone confirm that these people are actually making calls for both sales and service?
Jacob, Sam, Jayah and I huddled today about reporting in UCOMM. We need to make a turn to track more properly. Instead of using Hubspot landing pages, we're going to build our own landing pages and use Hubspot forms. This doesn't make a big difference in what we gather for Hubspot, but it makes it a lot easier for us to track which tactic the user came from. We'll probably use URL variables for each tactic to track. 

Since marketing already created a lot of the landing pages for our initial campaigns, Sam is going to hack those out to get the content on our own pages. 

This eliminates the need for a middle intercept page. 

We also made the decision that Jacob is going to take the rest of the UCOMM projects to work on so that the team doesn't have to wait on each other to get into files. Our goal is still early next week. 

Well, that is one of the few ways users can break our current setup... so long as the class limitations are in place on the line and they don't use phonecodes with more than one product class tied to them, things should work well. We can remove them from the phonecode classes if they fail to adhere to the limit (we would need an automated process to handle this since phonecode classes are managed by clients), but doing so would likely freak out quite a few clients - both because calls to those users would not be reviewed until a new phonecode class is added and because those users would not populate in product-specific reports that identify relevant users based on phonecode class.

That said, it would also force them to fix their phonecode setups... I would be a little hesitant to do this now since we've had so much server craziness lately that could shake client confidence in our reporting (and adding to that is probably not ideal), but on the other hand we can get it out of the way while they're already associating issues with something largely out of our control.

tl;dr yeah, that's one of the biggest issues we're facing... we can enact the change you suggested, but we hadn't yet because we didn't want to risk negatively impacting the client experience
Hello (most) everyone. If you currently have a support phone, or a mobile phone borrowed from support, return them.

Thank you.
I can't recall where (maybe you) but I've read some of his stuff before.  First one certainly resonates.

Awesome. Good luck.

Be confident in discussing our abilities to quickly ship on the most pressing issues.
Reid, I'm sure if you send over a business card they'll feel better. Oh wait. 
Got the next meeting with Tracy at NCH to scope this out a little more and identify the goals/budgetary constraints that they have. This has been scheduled the morning of the 23rd. I am going to be in Dallas permanently the following week, so I will set up some time for us to all connect after the NCH meeting to map out next steps. Ill also be sure to keep this board up-to-date. 
I wrote this late last night and I didn't give you enough brags. I want to reiterate how impressed I was by our support team.  It was one of the bumpiest weeks we've had in a long time, but all of you guys had a great attitude and pushed through the case load.

We've got a great crew.  All of our people should work with you guys more often to get a glimpse into your day.  I actually learned a lot. 

For the record if anyone comes across this board in the future. This idea is off the table.  No go on Star Wars.

Any and all Star Wars / Car Wars content is killed.
Media alerts have been sent. 
I can find all of the cost specifics that are needed below and am using that CI talking points document we created a while back that outlines what we do as a basis of what our "service" overview will be. I have attached this for reference.

I have a call with Jeanne tomorrow at 2pm where she would like to talk through this further. Another big element in our favor is the fact that there are a lot of people really happy with what we are doing for them. Ill post an update after this meeting along with an updated draft of what our "services" overview will be. 

@That being said, are there any statistics anyone can think of that would be intimidating without feeling like we are going over the top? 
Good point, but I am becoming less and less sensitive to overkill on questions like this.
@Kelly - Make sure you frame your challenges in a positive light, and keep it tied to how we help them grow. Avoid the trap of highlighting all the ways our clients inevitably slow us down, and come at it from an opportunity perspective.
Here are the questions that they asked Jeanne specifically: 

"So at a high level we just want to know what do we pay Century?

- What do we pay per number they provide?

- Is there an amount per minute?

- What have we paid this year to date?

- What have we paid over the last few years (are we trending up or down)?"

...the one downside that we have is that our trend of cost is increasing. BUT that being said, the fact that our costs are usage based and indicative of marketing success will absolutely be working in our favor. 

Jeanne has also specifically asked for an overview of service to provide to this group so that they understand the scope of what is done by CI. She specifically has asked to make sure that it is "not scary" but comprehensive of what we do- since this is not the real decision-makers, she does not feel anything that feels like we are trying to make a sale/scare them would be beneficial. I see what she means and think that the comprehensive list of what we do will be scary enough for them.
We have never been able to vForward within the scheduling page. 
2. CW Discovery never expires. He can have that one line as long as he wants. However, it is likely that he will frequently encounter upsell material within the product.
We'll also have the entire Car Wars platform to tease Car Wars inbound. 

Do you think it's overkill to tease all of the Car Wars reports (locked pods) like we do in the Discovery/Essentials products? 
Jeanne reached out to me yesterday afternoon about a GAP analysis that is being conducted currently by the Integrated Solutions Department about what the potential cost savings (if any) would be realized by taking the work that we do in-house to State Farm. The goal of the ISD team at State Farm is to regularly look at vendor relationships and do the initial analysis of whether it is worth even exploring bringing the work in-house instead of outsourcing to a vendor. 

I spoke to Jeanne about this today between her conference meetings to get a little more background about this group specifically. This type of analysis is something that is done regularly to all vendors and is not being done by people at the moment that have any kind of technical expertise- think a standard cost savings analyst and you would have a good understanding of this role. They have asked Jeanne several high level questions (next post will include these), but my read on the situation is that this is not a serious threat of any kind. This is done periodically to all vendors that SF uses and the best way to address it is to answer the questions they ask while also including the list of services/features that are included with this cost (and would be something SF would need to replace). The people in the ISD are not the ones that would make an actual decision about bringing in-house any of our services (so they are not the real decision makers)- they are the ones that decide whether it is even worth having any further conversation about exploring bringing the service in-house.
			
Is "RB Discovery Upgrade" the HS form fill attached to the Discovery page?
			
Done.  Let me know if I'm telling the story you're looking for them to see.  Then I can refine it into something fun and entertaining.
			
Spoke with Ed yesterday, great potential for upsell. He said that I called at the perfect time because his Auto-trader rep never got back to him on switching the destination number. He really really like the idea of Car Wars and how we listen to the calls. Like, for real.  Also, he got the login credentials email right away last week. BUT, however he did have two questions I didn't have an exact answer for. 

1.  How does Auto-trader feel about making a POD in our system and promoting only them for a tracking line? 

2. Does his Car Wars Discovery capability ever expire? Or can he forever have that one tracking line for free? Basically, after 30+ days will we be pushing him to make a decision?
			
Hell yea. Thank you! 
			
Tell me again why we have a 10 minute delay and Call Drip has 45 seconds? 
			
Should we add a teaser for full Car Wars?

"Want to see what's happening on your inbound calls?" 
			
I really enjoyed this article. I think that there are a application in both Humanatic and Demolition.

It's long, so if you want to get to the stuff that is CI applicable, you can jump to the halfway point.

I actually didn't realize that we never made a project for this.  We should definitely exclude activity performed by a CI employee.

let's get a project spun up.
That's probably a Toni question. 
Today we turned on authentication for listening to individual calls from CRM for all BHA accounts. We plan to turn this on for all elead, vin, and Dealersocket accounts in a couple days. Basically, the user must sign into Car Wars or cm.com with login, indicating their phone code, or creating a new phone code. This only happens once and then we cookie them for next time. It helps us know who is listening to calls. 

This is the same step as what we already have to look at summary reports from elead. 

This is just a heads up if you guys get any questions! 
 
		Let's talk about this. I think you are on to something	
@Jackie, should we tag the event platform as Car Wars or as "other" when closing out the TC? 
			
@Sam, any thoughts or ideas here? I think it may still be worth pursuing, as it makes the data pretty tricky to understand if we don't know the difference between us and the user. 
Is anything different about this eLead set up that would make it different than Dealersocket? Is it simply that we have a convenient way to set it up in this share tool for elead but have to do it manually for DS because we didn't build it into the tool? 
 
			
Background: see comment from Justin on this board: 

@Jackie we should get the functionality setup like we have with E-Lead. With the E-Lead summary post, we can configure work note shares in the XXML shares tool. With DS it has to be done manually on the back end database. Jian should be able to match the same setup.
@Justin, sounds good. I'll start a separate board to figure out what we would need to do here before starting a project. 
@Chris, previously able to do, as in, before MANDNIS? 
Thanks, guys. Keep me updated on feedback from the accounts that don't have much activity. I imagine there are places where we can make the process more intuitive. 
@Ashley, :) thumbs up 
			
Your brainstorm sounds really similar to my comments from 10:01 and 10:04.
Here's what I'm talking about 
			
Hey Keaton, 

After working our first big groups here and listening to several of Matt's RB demos, I wanted to bring up a reporting change idea. 

It's about the benchmark numbers we use. Right now, I have to manually add the "All Properties". With only 50-some properties using RB too, the numbers create a bit of a weird conversation. 

Is All Properties the industry average? - No, it's accounts on our system. 
How many senior living accounts do you have? - 10 accounts
etc. etc. 

Would static images of "Industry Average" that pre-populate when we create new accounts be smarter? I was even considering three different benchmarks - industry avg, industry avg. w/call center, rent buzz avg. 

Thoughts?


			
I spoke to Gary and we had a great conversation. There's a great potential for an upsell with them. 
			
here it is, what happened with this? 
			
 
			I want to return to this question:<br>
<i>"These are opportunities that need to be pursued. We want hcat 26 to weed out the leads that are not legitimate opportunities. Example: out of area. I don't think it matters too much if the reviewer fails to properly distinguish the true reason as Price or Schedule; either way it's an opportunity to pursue.

What's a better way to weed out the non-opportunity calls?"</i>

<b>Brain Storming </b><br>
Is an opportunity:<br>
- Client did not directly decline to book an appointment<br>
- Client or office promised a follow up call<br>
- price or insurance was discussed and the client did not directly decline to book an appointment ever<br>
- an appointment was discussed but was not scheduled.

Not an opportunity:<br>
- Service not offered/ Out of service area<br>
- Client declined to book an appointment with no indication of still needing to decide or calling back later

<b>What if we established some sort of scale.... hot to cold.</b>

<i>Cold</i><br>
- Procedure or service not available / location out of area

<i>Warm</i> <br>
(Appointment Opp that no appointment was discussed on, we then determine what was discussed)<br>
- pricing/insurance<br>
- procedures<br>
- pricing, insurance, and procedures<br>
- Other

<i>Hot</i><br>
- Appointment was discussed but not scheduled.

<b>What does that look like for humanatic?</b>(brainstorm)<br>
HCO 96 - Appointment Not booked would lead to....

#1 Was an appointment discussed?<br>
A) Yes - Done this is Hot lead.  An appointment was discussed but not scheduled.<br>
B) No - This is a warm or cold lead, we need more info

B) No goes to new HCAT<br>
What was discussed?<br>
Procedures - warm <br>
Pricing / Insurance - warm <br> 
Pricing, Insurance and procedures - warm <br>
Other - warm

<i> I haven't quite sorted out how we determine "Procedure or service not available / location out of area" which would be a cold lead.  Help me work through this guys. </i> 
I'll load a call each from DP-Dickson Center to DP-Fountain City 
			
we had another case or bb out regarding having their loaded call counts for quantitative purposes.  along with having their coached calls show as well.  It seems to have fizzled.  I will try to locate it and link it to this one 
			
Regarding virtually forwarding within a schedule: last we checked with dev, only the inability to add non-numeric characters prevents such forwarding, this was something we were previously able to do.

If there are reasons such forwarding is no longer feasible, we're not aware of them.
 
			If we grab all the phone skills hcats for all products, order them in phone a logical order, then find ones that are used in more than one product, I bet I could order them.

I have an idea to track performance for our guys here at Lead Tag. Similar to what we've done in launch with the scoreboard. I want use events for the various projects that are assigned to Lead Tag Consultants. Here at Lead Tag we work on various projects so, the three questions I would like to task in the event are below.
<br>
<br>
1. Describe the project in detail.
<br>
2. What team or individual is assigning the project?
<br>
3. What's the due date of this project? 
<br>
<br>
This data could be validated by myself, Maggie, or Dan for the Consultant to move forward. This will also be the formalized way for a CI employee to task a Lead Tag Consultant with a project. Once the project is completed the Consultant will be given credit via our scoreboard.
<br>
<br>
I would also like to highlight Inbound & Outbound activity. 
<br>
Unique calls > 3 minutes
<br>
30 calls / 20 unique conversations (for a day) 
<br>
<br>
<b>Any other ideas from the team?</b>

			
Marielda: Complete Dentistry - CVC

small sample size (June 2nd through June 9th) 
			
Ok, good deal. 
			
We need to get organized on what type of cases get pushed to Lead Tag and how it gets managed. Today we have sufficient capacity to handle the workload.
"Our biggest issue arises when an account has both car wars and service setter and the user has a single phonecode" 

Are you sure that's the case? If users are genuinely doing this, we just need to tell them to use separate phone codes for the two types of calls. If they fail to adhere, then we need to remove them from both classes.
Why hold off on #3?  Is there something I can do to push that forward? 
			
McCall, I know you're on the road this week. When you get back, will you outline how the visits went? I'm particularly interested in what you're doing and how we can scale up an entire team of people around you. 
			
 
OK, our first pivot:

At first we were only looking for ads that we could get specific contact information from.  We were avoiding the ones that only offered the anonymous Craigs List "reply" button at the top. (see attached for example)

I have decided that it would be silly not to reach out to these people as well.

I have added a second tab on the google doc to add links for these.  Just cut and paste the URL to these ads and I will email them.
		
Hold off on item #3 for now, but we'll definitely come back to it.

I'll be responsible for item #4 with the ability to create a consulting event in the new Demolition platform. 
			
Item #2 is already an active project:
1) Pool tool 

* Hacker Farm is about to rebuild this product. We'll make sure to include full support for management that doesn't require dev.

2) Set up a vForward within a schedule (Very busy around holidays)

Is the only limitation today that the front-end interface disallows a leading v?

3) Reactivate numbers based on length of time they have been inactive

<b>Jayah</b>, please create a project for a new administrative tool for reactivating a line. We'll need to be careful that lines get tested post-reactivation.

4) Bulk number deactivation

<b>Jayah</b>, please create a project for this new administrative tool. In the form that accepts the list of lines to deactivate, require a case # that documents the request. Keep a log of this.

5) ICDC set up by lskin instead of dnis - an overall management tool by lskin and by single number.

<b>Jayah</b>, please create a project for this new administrative tool.
Jashona found a solve for the sign up process.

@Jane, you can now feel free to use the Discovery link in marketing.  


Outstanding items:

• Amy is working on a validation to ensure that the user gives us first and last name. Entries without a last name have caused occasional issues in the creation of the account.

• The wizard is not yet turned on for this hproduct. We had a few bugs in the RB wizard that Ed was working on before he was out, and then the server prevented us from testing. We'll get this on as soon as Ed is back. In the meantime, we'll handle new RB Discovery accounts as one-offs.
			
Doing CD- Temecula to CD- La Mesa 
			
Ah yes, I forgot to remove that. I just used your extension since it was at the top of the list when I was doing some initial testing. This was testing on my computer though, not yours, so I'll go ahead and remove that. 
			
Lead Box is user-based though, so that won't work.

Maybe we'll do something with current missed opportunities. If we look at these by day, they'll just add up even if they've been handled. Maybe there is a solve like a query that would work like an account-level Lead Box. 

@Jacob, do you know of anything we currently pull for an "outstanding missed opportunities" statistic? As in, missed opportunities that have not yet been called back?
			
There are things filled in beside my name that I didn't fill in.  I have not tested this yet.  Did someone make a mistake --- or someone test mine for me...?   
			
Left a VM, no contact yet
My only contact is on vacation until 6/20.... 
			
Those are all great options.  I'd also like to include some missed opportunities information, maybe a # of calls waiting in the LeadBox?  This will get them engaged and logging into the platform to follow up with those missed opps. 
			
So my new approach is to ask for a list of salesmen via email I have contacted mini and BMW. I am now awaiting a call back from Hendrick mini- Office manager. Bmw has agreed to send me a list of used and new salesmen.

It'll change and scramble it for everyone sharing the HCATs, so no. 
			
Good call, Laura. As far at the media alert goes tomorrow, I would send that as just an email and not an attachment (replying to today's email). 
pdf with Kevin as the media contact:  
			
We can be even more aggressive. Subtract 1.6&cent; from each of those. Since the 10m is just a pipe dream, give them a great headline figure of 2.7&cent; for that last row.

Mention Humanatic as:

A full review from Humanatic typically only adds about 2&cent; per minute.
Will do! 
			
Is sorting by the column hcat_rank not an option then?

I'm with Keaton, the order it's listed in now is scrambled.  
			
If your name is listed for a topic (Jon, you're #8), please post an initial outline of your presentation by this evening. I'll give you some feedback so you can have it formed for review on Friday.

Use the appropriate visuals for a strong story. Jackie will probably need a good number of slides to show how Car Wars Discovery works, but Lauren's story will be more anecdotal (including the mandatory "pass this around" unveiling of a banana phone). 

These guys are cool, so have some fun with it.
The Charter school I worked for with over 700 students once had to move, set up, and open our doors in 4 days.  $*it happens, lol
Good plan, yes.. set me up at the media contact. 
			
I turned this into a pdf because I didn't like the look of it just as a long email. @Kevin, can I have permission to use you as the media contact instead since you'll be at the event? 
What about:

1. Scoreboard (no details, just overall points and points by day)

2. Inbound Calls Today: Connected # and %

3. Requested # and %

4: Booked # and %

3. Outbound Calls # and % connected for the day, # of calls from last week today and % connected that day

Is specific staff information used? Seems like that would be what is hard to read all at once.

June 10th non-update:

Yesterday we were negotiating with a new option that emerged on Friday. The conversation was temporarily stalled because the owner of the building sent his representatives an email saying: <i>I'm skeptical of these guys. It seems highly unusual that a legitimate company (especially of that size) would be scrambling to find space in such a last-minute, shotgun manner.</i>

That is, like, the most CI thing ever.
@Sarah, if you want to add anyone to LL for this store, will you make a case for Ian so that we don't just keep it in a bulletin board? 
			
I don't believe that we will be able to achieve a less than 1% congestion rate using only a single carrier, at least not with level3 anyway.

I've been in conversations with onvoy who are very interested in working with us and think they can be an improvement over level3.

Jack asked me to back off of that so I am, however there is nothing more I can do at this point to improve click to call's performance.
McCall and Jay will actually be onsite for the Rick Hendrick Import stores tomorrow and Friday, so you can pause training for now if it is too difficult to get to sales people.
On bridges, should the record option be on the entire routing profile, or controlled by extension?? 
			
Rick Hendrick BMW- I am having a difficult time reaching any salesman. Receptionist is not cooperating with me. There are many guys who either do not work there or work in different departments. The receptionist will only get agitated. Hendrick mini- Ben Toney and Garry Moon are currently calling. I will start calling Rick Hendrick Volvo of Charleston
			
I like hcat 25 how it is today. We don't want reviewers to make a subjective decision about what is / isn't an appointment opportunity. We just need to figure out why Not Connected calls made it through both hcat 25 and hcat 28 without getting flagged for correction.
@ Matt - I agree.  That sounds great.  Thanks!

I am excited about this by the way.  It's cool thing for us to be able to do!
The call content fit what is outlined in that hco. (wrong number, voicemail, hung up during bridge, voicemail, left on hold, etc).  
			
@Kelly - Yes, I was hoping to use this bulletin as a forum for initial questions, but that is a good point. It would probably be most efficient if I (or anyone else who knows how) gave a presentation showing how to setup zoiper from scratch and how to use the various features, and address all these common questions. <br />

I still think this should wait until the mobile configuration is done, since many of the answers to these questions may change during/after that project.  <br />

@Reagan - Yes, that would be helpful to keep track of who is registered already. Like has been said before, this is not mandatory yet, but for testing purposes it would still be useful information to have.
Why should the calls have been marked as no live conversation? 
			
That change would revert us back to getting many appointment ops marked as general calls.  I don't want it to contingent on an appointment being mentioned.
Perfect. That's what we were looking for. Thanks, Matthew. And would you like us to document in that excel sheet our test calls? 
			
@Matt - When the mobile portion is configured as well and this likely becomes mandatory to use, the entire accounts staff will need a training on how to use these.  It doesn't have to be you, but we have to remember that everyone has different learning styles and this may not work for many.  

They will need a hands on training and a forum to ask questions that many of us likely have so that you can answer them all at once.

For Instance:
- How will these calls be tagged in events.
- How does my number appear to clients.
- If a client calls the number they see back will it reach me, and where?
- What number do I give clients to call me at?  It needs to one number, not many.

I am not looking for answers to these now, but these are the types of things that will get asked.
From experience with media relations, I would say an idea timeline for something like this would be:<br>
<li>Today- send out release<br>
<li>Tomorrow- send out reminder "media alert" w/ who, what, where, when, etc. (replying to the initial email with the release) <br>
<li>Morning of event- call morning of (8am PST?) to follow up on release/alert and make sure they know RW is speaking<br>
The update looks good to me.  As to your question on emailing reporters.. Absolutely, that was the reason for the "ask" in the first place.  As for sending today vs. tomorrow, I'd opt for today since tomorrow may be a travel day for some.  Thanks 
			
I am loading from CD - Tracy to CD - Bakersfield  
			
Thumbs Up 
			
We could also benefit from another change in hcat 25.

'Live conversation about procedures / insurance / pricing / potential new appointment' should be changed to 'Live conversation about procedures/insurance/pricing<b> for a potential new appointment</b>'.

It seems small but I think it'll help. 
@Reagan - Excellent question. This project was to setup the zoipers, but their will be another one to configure moblie devices to work with this as well. For now yes, you do have two different tracking lines, but I would recommend simply not using the zoiper for much beyond test calls until the project to integrate the mobile and zoiper tracking lines is completed. 
Most of the non-opportunity calls were calls that should have been reviewed as no live conversation in hcat 25. 

We could rephrase the no live conversation hco in hcat 25, and then the correction option in hcat 28. This should help us catch those more easily. 
I now understand. Cool! 

The only reason I think we are confused (the launch team, that is) is because by reading the initial comment in this board, we didn't understand what was happening. We have to read through the entire thing and not just scan it, haha! We also didn't know that we were transitioning so we didn't have any background knowledge of this whatsoever :) But this is neat!
			
Got several more eyes on it. Changes made. 

If there are no more edits, I think we should start getting this out by 2pm today. I was talking to Taylor Pass, and she suggested we could send it out today and then do follow up calls tomorrow? Or send it out the day before the event so it's fresh on their brains.  

@Kevin do you want this emailed to all the reporters highlighted on the list? 
			
No contact with Bommarito..... Spoke to Benchmark CDJR and saw that the line was placed on autotrader but still not getting data.  Poor Marketing I guess.  But told him I would reach out to him friday and see if he has any data.  I think he put the number up on monday.  
			
The caller ID that shows up for me is not my assigned inbound number. It routes back to my computer, but not my cell phone. So does that basically mean that as an AC, I have two assigned work numbers by which I can be reached? 
			
I feel that there is plenty of explanation on how to set this up on this board, and I have already volunteered to address any specific questions that come up. <br />

The reason we are transitioning to this is because we will have a greater degree of control. These calls only require provisioning a inbound line, and outbound calls are sent directly through dialtag. This means we don't need to provision an actual outbound line; we just use a fake one for tracking purposes. <br />

@Toni - The callerid should be the zoiper's number. The zoipers can not only make calls, but receive them. If you want to test this, you need to use a different phone as the zoiper will probably act weird when trying to call itself.
What if we only changed the "other" option to "None of those topics were discussed" instead of rephrasing the entire hcat? This gets rid of the reviewers ability to go for the easy answer of "other" so quickly. 
Yeah, that's true. I agree.

Let's take a step back and think about the primary purpose of hcat 26. We know these are calls in which a potential patient did not book an appointment. These are opportunities that need to be pursued. We want hcat 26 to weed out the leads that are not legitimate opportunities. Example: out of area. I don't think it matters too much if the reviewer fails to properly distinguish the true reason as Price or Schedule; either way it's an opportunity to pursue.

What's a better way to weed out the non-opportunity calls? 
			
Does the caller ID route back to the AC/employee making the call? 
			
Any luck reaching anyone yesterday? Feedback? 
			
A couple of additional questions:  

Do we want to add pricing for # of lines?   

While they're explicitly asking to not include it in the tiered pricing, do we want to list out a Humanatic rate of something like $.28/min?			
@ Reid - I really don't think it would be the occasional call.  The only patient that would call and not ask about price or insurance prior to discussing calendar availability would be existing patients.  You will always end up with those ones being the first thing discussed because that's just how calls go at dental offices.
That takes me back to what I was saying about rewording the hco for insurance/price.

Below is what I'd propose for monthly minute volumes for Dealertrack.  My two points of reference here are a couple of other RFPs that have come across in recent months and J-Bird alluding to our desire to get aggressive based on a prior run at these guys.
good point... but then I'm worried they're no longer getting enough insight into why appointments aren't being booked.
From your example call about Cigna Insurance, we'd still want to know that an appointment was not booked due to Insurance.

The Car Wars phrasing focuses on the action of asking for an appointment because it's not always a natural opportunity in the flow of a dealership call. We want the guys to be conscientiously pushing toward the appointment. Most dental calls are focused on the possibility of booking an appointment, so I feel okay about our wording for hcats 25 and 28.

To Kelly's point: we would still report on the collected data from hcat 26 the same way. If price is discussed and an appointment doesn't get booked, we'll present that as a data point. I just want to figure out a way to make it straightforward and less subjective fort he reviewers. I would be okay with some collateral damage on the occasional call that mentions multiple trigger topics and gets falsely assigned to the first one mentioned.
Can we do some sort of short training on how to use this and how it differs from our current methods of calling?
 If we send them all to Reason Not Booked anyway, it kind of defeats the purpose of revising hcat 28. 
No. That comment was meant for a different thread where I was having some difficulty adding tables to database replication
That sounds good.  All at once we determine if an appointment was booked, not even requested, or declined.  Declined ones would then have information about what was discussed, providing the offices some guidance on what to follow up about.

I think that ones not even requested should also head to that same category though.  Because those are still missed opportunities and information about what was discussed would help them determine whether to follow up.

My only concern with using the Car Wars HCAT is the soft and firm appointment thing.  That is not industry lingo at all and will be extremely unfamiliar to them.  They are much more black and white, booked or not.
Pricing question from DealerTrack RFI:

Rate table for local and toll-free numbers by country. Tiered pricing for committed volumes: 1,000; 10,000; 100,000; 250,000 lines, and 1mm; 2mm; 5mm; and 10mm monthly minutes with average call length of 2.5 minutes. Indicate pricing for the base level service, with dedicated numbers (not session­-based), caller ID data, ADF leads, all calls recorded and retained for 30 days (without
transcription, outbound calling, call categorization, call scoring, etc.)
			
The callerid for the zoiper is the inbound tracking line it is configured with. You can call the zoiper through that number. 
			
What do we need to know about OB Caller IDs here? Test call worked great, but the Caller ID number is new.
 I also found that just searching "outbound" under jobs and gigs turns out some good info.
Thanks Mike 
			
We could send declined appointment request to hcat 26. 

Then if we really wanted to find out what happened on the calls where no appointment is mentioned, we could create a new hcat to encompass Reid's idea about determining what was discussed.  
			
What if we mirrored hcat 7 in Car Wars by asking if an appointment was actually requested/discussed somewhere in the Patient Pursuit flow? We could use hcat 28 to do this.<br><Br>
<ul><li>Appointment for a firm date/time
<li>Appointment for a soft date/time
<li>Declined the appointment request
<li>An appointment was not discussed
<li>Correction: not an appointment opportunity</ul><br><Br>

As it stands, we go straight from determining if there is a new business opportunity to to determining whether or not an appointment was booked. 

There are so many calls that come through sounding like this:<br> "Hi, do you accept Cigna insurance." // Receptionist or agent: "Unfortunately we do not accept that insurance." // Caller: "Thanks." // Call ends. 

We could filter these out before they ever even make it to hcat 26, and in turn save reviewers from confusing calls that end with "no reason given".

Based on Phils last post does that clear the congestion issue?

One other note is CI has only been on the enterprise upgrade since May so any data prior to May should show elevated levels of congestion. 
			
I do agree that would likely be an easier option for our reviewers, but I want to think through how this will effect the value of the product.  

What if they discuss a lot of things?  Calendar, Insurance, price.  

Most calls will start with... "do you take my insurance" , "how much is it?" THEN "lets see if I can get in when I need to"  

If listeners are just marking the first thing that's discussed, that's likely going to be insurance or price. The results may not be of any value to the office.  They use the results to help them determine what calls to follow up on or what objections their staff need more training to handle.
			
If we are just determining what was discussed, but not the actually reason for the appointment not being booked does this category still bring as much value?

My first inclination is to say no.  Someone argue that point with me.
the hangup that we find at Lead tag is confusion over insurance being the choice when the agent or caller says they will call back upon further digging as to whether it is taken or is a  ppo or hmo, this of course will affect ultimtely the price, but Insurance is what was discussed in most cases.  
Perfect!  Thank you!
Hey Sam

I was looking at the calendar and the office space is actually filled up that particular week, month, or few months that you might be referring to.  

Spaces fill up fast.  Will keep you updated.
Thanks for the status update, Mags.
thinking as I drive to office, had a boat load of bridges to voice this morning
We mainly want to know if price was discussed on a call that didn't book an appointment. Maybe the confusion is due to asking the reviewer to determine the primary cause / reason for the appointment not getting booked. Instead of asking for the Reason Not Booked, what if we rephrased this category to focus on whether certain things were discussed?
<li>Schedule / calendar availability</li>
<li>Insurance / price</li>
<li>A procedure or service that was not available / the location of the office</li>
<li>None of those topics were discussed</li>
<li>Correction: Appointment Was Successfully Booked</li>

We could just ask the reviewer to select the first match that is discussed.
This board is for testing zoiper softphones for a  <a href = http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/hproject_manage.cfm?pid=3108>Hubba Hubba project. </a>
The idea is to allow use of laptops with headsets to make calls directly through dialtag. I've set up extensions for all members of several teams as specified, and I want to make sure things are working properly before I mark the project as completed. <br />

I've tried to outline all the steps required to connect with zoiper, as well as identifying any potential pitfalls and clarifying the instructions wherever necessary. At this point the testing is about done, as multiple people have now confirmed this is working. I would still recommend at least downloading zoiper, creating your account, and making a test call, as I believe configuring these will eventually be mandatory, but for now this is on a volunteer basis mostly.
@Haley we will start calling these three dealerships today. 

Rick Hendrick BMW Mini or Charleston
Rick Hendrick Volvo of Charleston
Matthew - what is this for?  I do not believe the team has any context to this request.
I think we should change the wording of the hco "insurance / price". It may not help us decrease the percentage of calls that are filtered as other, but it should help reviewers answer the hcat question without any confusion (therefor minimizing how often reviewers are overruled, audited as incorrect, and penalized). 

We could change the first half to "Insurance not accepted". That's easy and a lot more clear.

The price discussion without a reason given seems to be the biggest issue though. How can we reword the "price" half of that hco?


Let's take off the throttle and just see how it goes.
So much aggression... 

I'd love to work out of CO for a week, a month, or a few months (depending on what I could work out with the wife).
OK.  I will book rooms now.
We just booked our flights.  The same as you guys!

I might be wrong here, but I don't think we all need to voice our desire to be a part of this on this board. Obviously most of us want to do this. There's going to be parameters other than "post on this bulletin board"
Tagged the rest of the departments that have the credentials to set this up. I noticed there were more tagged on this bulletin than are on the configuration sheet, so if you got tagged on this but don't have an account to setup, feel free to untag yourself. <br />

Everyone else should be able to configure their account. However, there are a couple details that have caused some problems previously that I would like to reiterate; <br />
1. Use your user id, not your phonecode. If you can't remember your userid, its recorded on the configuration spreadsheet. <br />
2. These only work locally currently; if you work remotely, you can still set this up but it won't be able to connect unless you are at the office. <br />
3. If there are any problems, feel free to contact me. I try to stay active on google chat, but commenting on this board works too. I've done a lot of trial and error with these zoipers, so chances are any errors that you encounter I've already dealt with in the past.
I'm down this sounds awesome
@Jackie, we didn't <i>want</i> to leave voicemails... but we never identified a fool-proof way to prevent them. The current approach (making the phone ring for a very short period of time before hanging up) was chosen because most phones that are on will ring for long enough that the call won't make it to voicemail before lead launch hangs up. For some phones / carriers, the threshold can be a bit different - also, if a phone is off, a voicemail is practically guaranteed since your phone will typically route those calls to voicemail after a single ring

It's just Sarah on the configuration right now - just let me know any additional number we need added and I can throw them in there. 

@Sarah, for the calls that dropped, that could be caused by not answering the phone before lead launch terminates the call. If you don't get to the phone in a few seconds, it'll hang up (as mentioned above, this was to combat voicemails... and isn't really as successful as it could be)

Hi Jon,

Joe and I are working on a reporting project that will help us include call measurement information directly into our national, and dealer specific reports. 

These reports will be seen by a wide variety of clients, OEM and dealers a like. 

After sampling all the reports we have available to us (and we checked making our own) we're really looking for something a bit different, it seems like you have all the pieces, just not in the way we want to see them. 

Below is a spec I've put together that we'll want to see. Joe, if you have any changes please respond here, thanks. 

Attached, I've included a proposed spec for this custom reporting. We wish to have all of our accounts (that we manage) activated for this report & have any new clients we sign up added automatically, as well. 

Can you please review the spreadsheet and let us know if this is something you can do? 

Thank you. 
@Kevin edit's made
I can't find the script John created in the project.

"The script is in my dev folder: infusionsoft/index.cfm"

Reading the API documentation, it looks to me similar to Salesforce integration. It does have Python SDK (Phil and Kyle's fav). It uses OAuth process. The implementation of the integration will take a lot of development time for sure.
UPDATE ALERT: We will start at <b>1:00 PM on Friday</b>
It just threw an error in the url and took me back tot he menu of pods.

It would make sense that it would work though.  I believe I've seen it be empty before and had people ask why there was nothing there and they hadn't added the groups to that account.

U think I'm safe to tell them we believe the reporting will look like that pod?
yes!
I got a tablet

1) are we offering any sort of special for sign-ons?

2) are there any one pagers or hand-outs I should get from the office?
Only a day and a half left to RSVP!  3 reasons why YOU should RSVP...


1.  Cam Champion agreed to do a stand up comedy routine.


2.  I'm challenging Thomas to a push up contest.


3.  We're graduating a group of REALLY awesome people.  



On that note (point number 3), we really are adding a handful of really talented, really great people to our CI family.  They're totally worth your time coming out to our office.  




RSVP & we'll look forward to seeing you Friday.

<b>Item #5 - Transfer knowledge</b>

Jackie is doing a great job keeping our sales team up to date on new product changes.  We should be recording these and delivering the presentations to support so they know what's in the pipeline and how to support it.  

AC's are hungry to learn and they are asking a ton of questions.  We just need to follow the right protocol so support can properly address tickets instead of questions that our launch team knows already.  Toni has already put in a chain of command so AC's can learn from their peers and launch leaders first.  

Chris and Dishon have also volunteered to teach 1 new tool or product during the Wednesday morning meetings.

<i>DELIVERABLE 1:  Jackie records the join.me product sessions, so we can give to support</i></br>
<i>DELIVERABLE 2:  Toni, Chris, and Dishon schedule the 10 min training sessions for next two months</i>
I'm on it! 
I'll reach out to him.  


<b>Item #4 - Send training cases to AC's</b>

A lot of cases represent chances for our AC's to build relationships.  Instances where clients don't understand scoring or reporting support should be creating a TC for our team to promptly reach out and train.  

Inbound calls are a challenge because we can't transfer them until we have a phone system.  We'll address this with the new phone system.

<i>DELIVERABLE:  Add a "Convert to TC" button to cases.</i>
<b>Item #3 - Leverage Lead Tag </b>

Let's start leveraging Lead Tag for the cases that are pretty straightforward, so we can leave the more technical troubleshooting items to our support team.

Cases for Lead Tag:  Create phone codes, setup new numbers, deactivate numbers, etc.

<i>DELIVERABLE:  Add a "Send to Lead Tag" button</i>
<b>Item #2 - Case Assignment and Reassignment</b>

The auto-assign tool works pretty well in farming out tickets.  The only small adjustments we need are as follows:

1)  Cases shouldn't auto assign to people who are sick or are off. </br>
2)  If someone is sick or taking a day off their cases should be reassigned in the morning. </br>  



<b>Item #1</b>

Our support team requires dev to assist in a lot of areas.  This takes the control out of the hands of support while they wait for dev to run queries.  This cuts into the time that our dev team could be spending building new projects and tools.  

I'm opposed to over engineering things, but here are 5 tools that address common requests.

<b>1)  Pool tool </b></br>
a.  Remove individual pool members</br>
b.  Converting and adding recently ordered numbers into their pools</br>
c.  Convert pool members into standard tracking lines</br>
<b>2)  Set up a vForward within a schedule (Very busy around holidays)</b></br>
<b>3)  Reactivate numbers based on length of time they have been inactive</b></br>
a.  Display the deactivation date and last known ring to, if available</br>
<b>4)  Bulk number deactivation</b></br>
<b>5)  ICDC set up by lskin instead of dnis - an overall management tool by lskin and by single number  </b></br>
This week on support was very insightful.  I appreciate the entire team answering all of my questions.  

Here are the major takeaways that will help us cut down response time and improve our customer experience:

1)  A few more support tools will take a lot of work off of dev and put support in control (Top 5 above)</br>
2)  Our case assignment works, but it could use a few improvements </br>
3)  LeadTag has a lot of smart capable people who can help us </br>
4)  Lots of cases represent opportunities for AC's to train and build relationships</br>
5)  We need to distribute knowledge to our support team and AC's more effectively </br>

I just talked to my professor. I'll be able to go. How would I book flight?
Boo. 

Have to reschedule this to happen on Wednesday, June 17 (likely familiar to you as Bunker Hill Day - dress appropriately). 

Sorry for the inconvenience. 

@Laura, made a number of edits.. mainly to address this to a broader audience vs. to a target customer (since most of the attendees would not represent potential end customers for Service Hook or our other applications.)
We all met today. We are going to work to get a fill form to setup BDR created.

Or second option would be to train Pam in the BDC to provision lines herself, setup phone codes, etc. All she would need to do is get outbound lines converted and have outbound caller ID's implemented.
To clarify, it looks like we are still asking Hendrick to send CI support the BDR info so our team can set them up.<br>

@Dishon, is your team good with this and clear on the process? 
It's me and Ian I think. or just me.<br>

Yeah the VM is basically the LL message only it's cut off due to the beginning being: "You have reached Sarah Thomas...I cannot take your call...blah blah"<br>

I talked to Sarah Vantine today and she is going to talk to Jimmy, the GM, and Frey tomorrow but they may be ready to try it. She knows it takes approx 10 minutes and may be ok with it.<br>

I think it would be good idea to add Sarah Vantine's number to the test for her to see what it sounds like.
Are you the only one on the LL calls for that store?

@Ian, do we leave voicemails if no one picks up? I can't recall. 
We can test it...there may just be some weird-looking placeholders there. 

What happens if you log into their account and just type in that pod instead of another in the URL? Most data will be blank, but you might see what the benchmark portion looks like. 
@Jacob, let's get on a call tomorrow and make sure we have a good plan for building out this reporting, and to make sure I don't miss any important steps. 
Here's a new project for that middle intercept page. 
Will do! Thanks Taylor! 
cfinput can validate many types of input including phone number.
Batch insert example <br><a href="http://sqlserverplanet.com/data-warehouse/transferring-large-amounts-of-data-using-batch-inserts">http://sqlserverplanet.com/data-warehouse/transferring-large-amounts-of-data-using-batch-inserts</a>
Creating a project
1. Do you think the below suggestion is worth pursuing?<br>
2. If so, could we add something to the login page to run the find insert eligible calls sp on login if their last logged in is null/outside of the range?<br>
Or....another idea to reduce the insert count....
I can invite some local Hendrick folks.
They will have default configurations, but once they log in and get the lastlogged date within the date range, it'll take until the leadbox process runs again before they see calls. 

If they configure their lead box, then leadbox will populate their lead box with calls immediately. 
and by only I meant <i>mainly</i>
Do they have to configure the loggin first before any calls will populate?
The flow in concern 1 would actually look like this:

1. User logs in and now gets a lastlogged in the range<br/>
2. User <b><i>configures</i></b> leadbox(this causes the query to ran on that user login creating calls)<br/>
3. Calls populate
The ideal room would be filled with only prospects, but also want the room to be full. So...if we could get a few current clients to come share their success stories, that would be great. <br><br>Then if they could share with us anyone they know not on CW, but who would benefit from attending and learning more, we will invite those prospects. 
Yes, the "everyday" monitor stores use needs a face lift. I would suggest start with modeling it after what we use in the CI office. Keep it simple and keep one metric to each page and have it rotate to the next metric every 30 seconds.<br>

I've heard from stores - there is too much information trying to fit on one page. For example, if a store has 30 people answering the phones/making calls it's hard to see them all on the page and you can't scroll down.

Tagging myself.  I would love to be a part of this.
I'm a bit confused - is the goal to get PROSPECTS (not current clients) to attend, but current clients ARE invited and encouraged to attend as well?<br>

So, when we reach out are we asking them two things?<br>
1) would you like to attend?<br>
2) do you know anyone who would like to attend?


Hayley, any Lithia stores in area to invite? What about Hendrick in Frisco...?
Alex M - Cam is out tomorrow.  Can you look at Hayley's post here and move forward accordingly?


Oh. I am very interested in this. Can I help?
Concern 2 "app push notifications are built around those configs
as are axreports"<br>Dont have thoughts on this one yet...
1 concern<br>"Jackie brought up a good point: I'm a user that hasn't logged in for three weeks. I log in, and my leadbox is empty."<br>
This shouldnt be able to happen if my flow is correct. <br>
ex. <br>
<br>
1. User logs in and now gets a lastlogged in the range<br>
2. User loads leadbox(this causes the query to ran on that user login creating calls)<br>
3. Calls populate<br><br>@Jacob, is this the correct process? 
Immunet is more of an add on if anything. It is cloud based and has an extremely minimal footprint. It's designed to work with other programs like NANO AV. I couldn't tell you about the installation of Comodo b/c I was not taking part in technical things at that time. I just expected whoever set them up did it correctly.

And the infections were mainly a whole lot of spyware/adware but one of them completely crashed.

The correct thing to do would be to have a central host that performs the scans on the client computers...

@Dan, why not send a note:<br>

"Amir, it was great running into you again this past weekend. I would like to connect you with my colleague, Mike Haeg, who works with you guys (or who you've talked to before...etc). The three of us could grab lunch next week. Let me know when you're free."...
@Jay -- are you still communicating with the store level contacts (GM) at these stores? If so, can you send them a one-pager re ICDC and that we'll be reaching out to train at the store level, even though BDC will be handling most calls. If not, I will reach out via email.

@Cam -- can we do store level training for the following stores as well

Rick Hendrick BMW Mini or Charleston

Rick Hendrick Volvo of Charleston

Thank you guys!
yeah I feel pretty dumb

lol there was a checkmark on the right that said "display only checked articles"

I unchecked it and viola
I can do that time.  BP, are you here?
So we're not able to set the check time? I'd be fine with once every 15 minutes.

I've had CAV installed for the past two months and it's been running great: limited distractions, always updated, and it consumes minimal resources.

* Try removing Avast and reboot - See attached article on why to not run multiple AV.

*What was infected/running? Are we sure the issue didn't exist before the AV was installed (Full scan after install)?

*What error are we seeing for not being able to reach it's database? 

*Review your settings to silently quarantine threats without any user intervention. (Security Settings > Antivirus > Realtime Scan: Detection)
I want to jump on this bandwagon. Colorado loves me. 
There's no difference between how we initiate the OB leg of a CTC and a regular call, in fact both cases LITERALLY use the same lines of code.

the disposition "ctc_failed" is reserved for cases where we were unable to initiate the agent leg of the call due to congestion/busy/invalid number.
@Sarah it should be good now.
Removing avast won't have a huge impact on performance considering we just started using it and when we were only running Comodo, it had the same impact on speed and performance with no other AV software installed. Comodo also allowed multiple computers to become infected. There was also an issue of Comodo not being able to reach it's database for whatever reason. Even though a big red banner was displayed, people were not letting us know about it.

I am running NANO AV as well as Immunet on one of our pc's and there are no issues. I don't see the problem with switching away from comodo. It's all freeware... I want an AV to do what it's made to do and not constantly ask you to manually go in and fix threats - Most of our agents just close the window and go on with their day.

As far as screenshot 5 goes, I don't know exactly what it was doing... It was just running normally with active protection.
BHA has a slew of folks who to add bodies.  

John Poe at Town East Ford would be all over this I suspect.  

Huck, can you take the lead on getting him out there?
Pod 106 looks like a great solution!  What if we never associated their Lskins with groups?  Wouldn't that leave the benchmarks empty?
Do we see the same rate of congestion on the OB leg of a regular call?

If not, what's different between how we initiate the OB leg of a CTC and a regular call? 
Oh I must be thinking of the one from GM 1. I will keep hunting.
@Taylor -- can this be changed to not view only.  I've spotted a couple that are current clients but not marked as such. 
It's all about what's easiest for you! 
It should probably be a new project
Seattle 16th


Spokane 18th
Would it be easier for you if we divide our info on spreadsheet by our different sections? Or does it matter?
Set up.
Reminder: Lithia dealerships do not have admin access at the store level. To turn on click-to-call or update telephony ID's they will need to reach out to their computer services department.

Compserv@lithia.com 
Another important note I forgot to mention; this only works while actually at the office, as it is a local connection to the server handling the connections. You will not be able to connect while out of office.
Nelson Mazda! 
Do you think this is a piece we should add to all of the tactic back end projects like the one Cody has here, or should we create an entirely new project and incorporate that into each tactic?

Mine worked as well!
Mine worked! Volume needs to be pretty high to hear through the headphones but its good sound quality.


@BP - yes they were valid numbers.  an invalid number would return with a sip 404 which we indicate using the "invalid_number" disposition
@Kaiti, you only need to enter the user and password, and the client should connect. For you specifically, it will be; <br />
user: 0150@10.100.1.30:5061 <br />
password: ac_zoiper_0150 <br /> <br />

The third box, domain, can be left blank. This is because we specify the domain in the user box. <br />
Account name appears in the second step, but it should already be filled; it just uses the previous information you entered. Just click next without altering anything.
Right. Then we could use the same link for all banners or whatever. We'll just need to have a variable that says what campaign was being clicked.
Mike, I recently met Amir Amirrezvani, Co-founder of DealerOn. We met a few weeks ago at Gloria's during brunch. We didn't talk much business, mostly just about him and his wife moving to Dallas that same morning. 

I happened to run into him again this weekend in Lower Greenville. We chatted for a second and he said, "We need to do business together." I told him you were the man to talk to. I don't know what the past talks have been, but I thought I'd let you know. 
So regardless of the campaign landing page, we route to a middle page to track the click (no matter how they got there), and then redirect?

Would that mean that we would need to link to that middle page if we use a hyperlink, in a lightbox alert, for example?
@Phil- For those congestion calls... are all of the numbers dialed valid? 
Works great!
Great. Will let you know!
I dug around a little deeper in Jamal's spreadsheet of reviews and listened to some of the calls myself in hopes of seeing where we may have an issue. (I'm certain there is one.)<Br><Br>I pulled 50/100 of the calls reviewed by Jamal and Felix and this is what I found:<Br><BR>

I'm having the same issue as Jane and have been using the 4-digit user id number. Is there anything else I can try? I noticed that there were no directions for the "Account Name" box. Do we need to put something specific in there?
@Jess, we would love if someone or a few people from the local ASB stores can speak and  give a testimonial to prospects at the event. If they have other GM friends not on CW, it would be great if they can spread the word to them as well. 
1 definitely for me.


Thomas has to check with his professor and will update the board first thing tomorrow tomorrow.
Email draft:
From those screenshots, you also have Avast AV running which could cause some issues. Uninstall all Avast AV processes and restart.

Is Comodo (CAV) setup to only scan (1) at a designated after-hours time, and (2) only when new files are written to the system? The disk usage indicates it's actively scanning the system -or- processing incoming files. It should not be the latter because were only talking about web pages.

Screenshot (5) is different than the other four because only a single CAV process shows up. What was CAV doing different during this time?
Are you asking us to invite more people or to have our contacts spread the word to other GMs?

I can invite the local ASB stores!
Here's the link to the Google share doc.

I REALLY appreciate the help here.
Just to clarify, the four digit code is your user id, not necessarily your phone code. If your phonecode happens to be the same as your userid than that will work, but if it is different than you need to use your user id. If you don't remember your user id, you can check on the <a href = https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PELBH1s3Mu5RGw0hLoOHO_QjdrV92S6yV9i7EqhiTa8/edit#gid=0 >configuration spreadsheet. </a>
We're late here. Move fast.
We didn't make one for GM II, but are working on one for GMIII.

However, that will be customized to GM stores, and only show CRISP and the CRISP scores of the GM III stores.


I will <b> aggressively </b> await your feedback sir! 
20mpbs per user is the highest we can go on throttling with the wireless access points without removing the throttling and assuming the internet connectivity has been fine in the past few weeks (since we removed the throttling from CIHackers) then I don't have a problem with removing the throttling.

However, I don't think it will push us past the 20% utilization.
I'm going to get <u>aggressive</u> on Sunday when I'm in the Denver area.

I'll let you know what I find.  Golden is only 10 mins from Morrison and there is a lot more around there.  
We made one for last grudge match...but I don't know where it is or what it had on it. 

@Katherine, any ideas? Have you run across this again?
Here is the list of people we are targeting already. Any additional from y'all would really help our reach! <br><br>
Let Lauren or me know if you have any questions.
Hendrick BMW/Mini/Volvo are trained only in regular call-end digit collection.
Do any of y'all have time this week or next to reach out to current clients that we have good relationships with and who would be willing to spread the word about our Car Wars micro event in Dallas on June 24th? It is a lunch & learn event at The Capital Grille. <br><br>

This is the LinkedIn messaging we have been sending out: <br>
Hi David! <br>
We're hosting an exclusive, free lunch & learn event on June 24 at The Capital Grille in Dallas, and you’re invited.<br>
During this session you will learn:<br>
<br>
• How to squeeze more revenue from your existing call volume<br>
• How to bridge the gap between your people, process and tracking to sell more cars<br>
• How to create an “appointment culture” in your dealership<br><br>

At the event you will hear from dealers who have installed breakthrough phone processes that have made them hundreds of thousands of dollars in car sales, as well as learn how to apply them to your dealership. <br><br>
The three course steak lunch is absolutely free. As an aside, I wanted to let you know that this invitation is non-transferable and exclusive to you. The registration page below will be active as long as we have seats left:<br><br>
The Capital Grille- June 24<br>

Don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. We look forward to seeing you in a few weeks!<br><br>
Thanks,<br>
Taylor Pass
I keep getting this message. I retyped the server info multiple times, even copy and pasting the info from this board.
That's the highest we can go on throttling, right? Is our only other option would be to remove the throttling? Surely that would push us past 20% utilization.

When we start running VOIP in the office, can we create a new, dedicated unthrottled SSID? If CenturyI starts to act up, we can restore the throttling to maintain QoS for VOIP.

the only way I can think of is to have a page that the clicks will route to, then this 'middle' page will route the user to the correct landing page. This way, there is a common page that all clicks will come through and we can track each click that way. 

Its the same basic principle that we use for axreports with touch.cfm.
It seems like pod 122 (Reason Not Connected Breakdown) works on HCAT 18. Check out callmeasurement Mr. Appliance.

There's also the Answer the Phone pod (106, check Showcase in callmeasurement) which works on both HCATs...but that pod has benchmark data pulling from automotive groups. 

I can't find an ideal pod for them to use those HCATs. 
I'll take on the Discovery store once we get a full account name. 
Per offline chats with Matt, everyone on this board needs to follow these instructions:

1. Download Zoiper via Matt's comment below. Use the free "community" version.<br>
2. Follow the installation steps. Once you pull up the program (after it downloads), go to settings > create new account.<br>
3. Select SIP<br>
4. Username = yourphonecode@10.100.1.30:5061<br>
5. PW = ac_zoiper_yourphonecode<br>
6. Domain/outbound proxy = leave blank<br>
7. You should get a message that you were successfully set up<br>
8. Click "Dialpad"<br>
9. Call anyone with headphones in your computer!<br>

If you can't hear anyone on the other line, try turning up your volume on your computer.


STX - Fredericksburg-STX - Irving Heights: Shamitka will take these calls.
Project for backend reporting attached here.

@Jacob, Sam is going to <a href="http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/hproject_manage.cfm?pid=3333" target="_blank"> add a field</a> for each campaign to designate the landing page that we will be tracking conversions on and sending users to from each tactic.

We'll need to track click throughs to this landing page from each tactic. Some tactics are obvious. If you click an ax_report banner, you'll go right to the landing page. I'm concerned on how we'll track clicks to the landing page from something like the lightbox popup message. The plan was to link to the page from hyperlinked text, but now I'm concerned that that will be difficult to track.

Do you have a good idea on how we might track click through rate for each tactic listed on the project? We won't be tracking the TC or proactive chat greeting immediately. Direct mail info will be pulled from Hubspot.
Here are the screenshots of Comodo's activity. The main thing slowing the computers down is the high read rate of the hard disk drive. The other issue is the amount of threads running on the cpu.

After doing some research I'm thinking the following security software will be a good combination.

<a href="http://www.immunet.com/main/index.html">Immunet</a><br>

<a href="http://www.nanoav.ru/index.php?lang=en">Nano AV</a><br>

The link below is a zip file with the 2 statements saying that both of these programs are free for commercial use.


For documentation - Dustin is taking over Benchmark CDJR for me. 

It may be worthwhile for someone to call the first Discovery account we got. Just to see how they're doing. Jackie, do you remember their name?

I have reserved us a rental car (SUV) for pick up at the airport.

For my own future reference Heartland Address <br>

My flight is booked.  Flying out with you KF.

I will book hotels once Team Lead Tag is confirmed for # of travelers. 
This is the same graph in Patient Pursuit - basically what we're requesting (aside from the differences in verbiage)
Here is what the bar graph looks like now
Keaton and I have an update request for the bar graph present on the Rent Buzz Performance Report. Currently, it displays total call count data and appointments booked data (I assume firm + softs appts.) We feel there is more valuable data we should be presenting to our clients on a daily/hourly break-down.

Because Rent Buzz does not have have the Tracking Line Call Summary pod (like PP and CW), clients have no way to see the daily spread and call traffic and, more importantly, what hours during the day that they're missing calls. Groups have asked about seeing that data and because it's present on every other vertical, I'm pushing for it here. 

The rational to replace booked appts. with leasing opp. is to because that data is more actionable. "Looks like the most leasing opp calls happen between 11am-1pm and on Mondays. I'll make sure my best people are on the phone then." 


Here is the proposed metrics we'd like displayed in the new bar graph: Total Calls, Unconnected, Leasing Opportunity
I'm in for this location.

Let's aggressively investigate it Justin.
1) Yes: FTP, SSL, TLS

2) Include information regarding the Vendor service/product represented by the engagement:<br />
FTP/SSL/TLS: Secure FTP server integration for EL.<br />
SSL: reporting website

3) Vendor Systems Solutions person: @MattC- Have at it. You can also tag me for this.

4) Vendor’s access to State Farm data: Disc storage? This should cover EL


 
I will continue to reach out to both of them but one is OOO until Thursday and the other until Friday. 
"we'd have to see if there are any of call measurement pods that might potentially report on it."  This is what I need to know now.  What report can show that?  What does it look like?  Can they only get it in the excel?
Turning hcats on is no problem, if they are going to be getting that data from call measurement we'd have to see if there are any of call measurement pods that might potentially report on it. 

They can grab the information from excel downloads and from the "details" tab, that I know for sure. 
Here's the 2nd version of Scott's mockup:

The overlays here would show for Outbound Discovery. 

I prefer showing the benchmarks (without "You" data) to Outbound Discovery (as opposed to keeping those for CW Outbound) because the report wouldn't have much to show Discovery without them.

We also added a piece for returned inbound calls at the bottom. 

In front end, we'll probably add a column on staff to show returned inbound calls (from Smart Routing).
Miking says he will book our hotel, so he can pile up Hilton points.  I didn't really care so, if you're down with him booking yours please post here how many rooms you need.

I need one room.

Dan? Tee?
Sounds great! That and the lease leak calculator are great tools for you. 
Don't think this would work for clients with extreme objections (they tend to be pretty obtuse and unwilling to listen to reason). However, I could/should start leveraging this more in my email campaigns.
Thanks!!
Continue to reach out to the following GMs re ICDC:

Hendrick Motors of Charlotte

Hendrick BMW Northlake

You do not need to contact:

Hendrick Mini

@Jay -- are the following stores trained on ICDC?

Rick Hendrick BMW Mini or Charleston

Rick Hendrick Volvo of Charleston
CIHackers is not throttled.  I think CenturyI is throttled at 20mbps per user.
To make it clearer, here are the accounts that were NOT reached:

Hendrick Mini

Hendrick Motors of Charlotte 

Rick Hendrick BMW Mini or Charleston

Rick Hendrick Volvo of Charleston 

Hendrick BMW Northlake


For all of the other accounts, the GMs were reached and training on ICDC was conducted. 
Per Andrew: all accounts were reached except Hendrick BMW Northlake

Per Taylor: only one was successfully reached, Hendrick Mercedes Benz of Durham
@Monica - Yes! That would be great actually. We will have to update some of our online tools like CRISP and the lease leak calc. I will be updating those soon anyway so I'll get the verbiage on those fixed when I make some other adjustments. 
This google doc may help. Every store with Jason Hilton associated to it needs 1) a call to the GM and (Ryan's team) 2) store level staff trained on ICDC (Cam's team).

I have sent an email re ICDC to every GM under this umbrella.
Looks like we should be flying into Champaign IL / CMI <br>
Tickets aren't cheap since Southwest does not fly there, right under $500.  

I'm flying out Monday evening from DFW on American Airlines flight 3055 at 6:30 PM direct to CMI arriving at 8:36 PM <br>
Flying back Wednesday 6:30 AM Morning on flight 3089 to be back in DFW by about noon Wed (None of the Tuesday night flights were late enough).

I will rent a car and share with whoever.  If you want to share my rental car, please try to get flights that arrive at CMI around the same time Monday and/or leave the same time Wednesday.

Will post hotel details next.
Morrison, Colorado is smack dab in the middle of everyone's location.  It's about an hour from Fort Collins, Winter Park, and Colorado springs.

Morrison is home to the best concert venue in the entire country: <b>Red Rocks</b>

The outdoor scene is amazing and still close enough to Denver if AC's want to AirBnB in the city.
Wifi connection speeds are throttled. @Phil- what are our options for throttling?
Now that I think about it, I do not know if it will matter if the data is restricted to only the 8 below.

North Dakota - June 10th and 11th
@Ross.. re getting cc'd on email blasts.. The PHCC doesn't appear to send out a lot of email (as does Svc RT).  I'll find out how we can get more than me included on what does get emailed. <br>
Re our OWN email blast (from the PHCC to their members).. I've got an open question to our contact to find out just WHEN we can do it.  I've also asked if we will get a list of the folks that have opened the email.  They will take our content and send it out, after reviewing and approving it.  In addition to the Blast, we can the use of their member email list (that they will send us in an excel format).  I've asked them if it makes sense to FIRST send out a PHCC sponsored Blast, before we'd send our own email out.  That's the sequence that makes the most sense to me.  Separately, for our fee we're not supposed to get a member list, but it does appear that we will get an excel list of members once we decide to send our own email out.<br>
In summary, my thinking is that (in July), we send out a PHCC sponsored blast to their members, then follow it up with our own email 2-3 weeks later.<br>

My request to Laura, Ross and to MJ... please time to visit the site (using the log in info that you'll see in the email to me) to get more familiar with the various communications mediums, their current partners, key state PHCC officers/contacts, and the content in general.   After "casing" the website, get together and compare your notes.  After that, next week, I'd like to get a summary from you on what and where we should focus our time and energies with PHCC (beyond the emails and attending their nat'l show on 9/28)<br>

Thanks!

Kevin


Team, reminder that this list is still available for TC candidates!  

Make sure you are claiming on the document the accounts you are reaching out to.
Correct. 

It would simply be a query or accounts + lines + labels + total calls to that line that day.

nope
Avi - exactly, close them on meeting us.
Sounds good. If they ask if we're competing with Ellis, I think I should say no. I think if they express any interest in finding out more about what we do then I should tell them about how awesome we are so that they can't wait to meet us at NAA.
Case created to remove tenant and unit from hcat and call summaries
Ryan -- can you get with your team to see if they1) have reached every GM and 2) see if they have conducted in house training or not.

I will send ALL GM's an email in the next hour with the ICDC one-pager.
#8 will have to be all Jongers. I am at the Penske ISM Conf
This board will be used to discuss the current CarWars.com/monitor link that a handful of stores currently use in their break rooms or BDCs.  

Here is the login information for a current account that uses this link:

Username: bmwoffreeport
Password: freeport

<i>Can we invest some time into making the appearance of these reports consistent with the CarWars platform?  I think the relevance of some of the data currently displayed is questionable, but overall this could be an easy fix.

Do we know how many users are actively logging into this monitor link?</i>
At the moment, our efforts here have mostly been focused on the limit_frn_phonecode_classid column in hcat_dnis (we have been assigning the values to all lines in accounts based on their product participation) for outbound lines since hcat 87 solves most of the issue here for inbound - for the actual agents' phone code classes, we went through and attempted to assign the classes based on the type of calls they frequently made (we tried to pick one or the other - ideally, no agents <i>should</i> have both classes ). 

To my knowledge, generally, phone code classes are user assigned via callmeasurement - often, users will edit their phonecode classes since there are a few pods that only pull agent lists based on the phonecode class tied to the agent's phonecode and they want to display the user on some report or other. 

Upon looking through some of the old code we've written to combat this, I came across the linked project in which we automated assignments of phonecode classes. I believe some alterations need to be made to the sprocs for this to make things work a bit better

Our biggest issue arises when an account has both car wars and service setter and the user has a single phonecode that they use for both types of calls. So far as I can tell at the moment, we either need specialized lines (so they don't need the limitation) or a way to force users to use distinct phonecodes so we can tell if the call was service or sales
I'm excluding a lot of important topics that are high priorities for us. Before you feel slighted by your omission, recognize that I didn't create a slot for Keaton or Bryan...so obviously this isn't intended to be a parade of our top people.
With the exception of Dan's segment, these presentations will take place at your work area. Since it's just the two of them, we'll have someone run ahead of each session and set up chairs at the next station. I'll prepare a schedule sheet that has each presenter's bio and topic. 

When Larry and Dan get to you and are ready to go, you'll start with one or two sentences about who you are and what you do. Then jump right into your topic. They might break in with questions, or they might sit silently and just take it in.
I'm not sure.  I haven't been involved with these from a sales point of view.

Mary, do you have any scoop?  Can you ping the DS folks for a casual check in?

Addition between #9 and #10: Lead Tag -- pursuing prospects on behalf of our users

We'll have a Hangout set up for Dutch to talk about Lead Tag's service. It'll be cool to have the call center activity in the background so Larry and Dan can get a glimpse of the Zang office.
Assignments -- let me know if you're not here next Tuesday afternoon.

Sarah S is out of town on Tuesday. Mary / Jong would do great with #8.
Well, the geofencing stuff may be fixed in the new version of the iOS app - the old version manually forced a geofence check every 30 seconds, which is absurdly frequent. The new version uses the iOS's native border-crossing events, which trigger much less often and the iPhone can be a lot more smart about when it checks. The downside to that approach is that we have a longer variation on delay for detecting whether the user's in their geofence (up to 3 minutes, if I remember correctly), but it should knock down both battery and data usage.
We can't rely on users manually flipping presence on and off if we ever want to route calls using presence, but we also won't be successful if our app eats up data and kills peoples' cell phone batteries. 

iOS has the option to turn on location services "While using the app" but this won't work for us, because we will need to always have this detection running in the background.

How can we edit geo-fencing to determine data without impacting data and battery life so much?

Is there a way to ping for location less often than we currently do? Is this under our control or under the control of how location services work on iOS and Android?
Each block will have a presenting owner who will introduce Larry and Dan to something interesting we're working on. The order may change, but here's my initial outline:

1. CRISP -- XYZ Honda uses Car Wars to own the phone

2. Car Wars Discovery -- what it is, the strategy behind free, equivalents for other products

3. Humanatic -- the wizardry of Humanatic: scaling, challenges, review centers

4. ICDC and Affectation -- how a cool new feature gets to market

5. SaaS selling -- how we generate MRR

6. Product Marketing -- creating leads

7. Sales -- a lead arrives

8. Selling through the network -- adding users from CRM partners and client referrals

9. Growing -- what happens when a new group joins Patient Pursuit

10. Keeping the wheels on -- how the Go portal supports everything we do

Avi - when you call these leads, your goal is to nurture them, to get them to the booth.  Here are the guidelines:

- I'm calling to let you know we got your request

- You must get direct access to the person who opted in (do not share information with gatekeepers or anyone other than the person who opted-in)

- Before we conduct our calls I wanted to ask you a few questions to make sure we deliver the best results for you (list your questions, keep them basic)

- Do NOT spill the beans on Rent Buzz, as in don't sell them on the product

 - Gather their cell phone number and all other direct contact information (reason for getting this is so we can communicate directly with you and keep this information private)

- Verify they're a decision maker

- Tell them we look forward to meeting them and reviewing the results with them at NAA

- Leave them with anticipation and a commitment for the meeting
Some initial feedback on the Car Wars app has me concerned about the geo-routing feature (which is really the focus of the whole app). 

To illustrate the problem in anecdotes: 

* Jayah turned off the location services on the CW app because it ate up all of his monthly data.

* I turned off the location services on the CW app because it killed my battery every day.

* Darin at Crest Cadillac complained about both problems, and said that those using it at his store turned location services off and just used the manual presence toggle to indicate presence instead. 


@Jane, I'm going through the RB Product and cleaning up instances where we use some of the words below. We're definitely guilty of using Unit and Tenant a lot of places. 

Do you need any help reviewing some of our marketing materials?


Mock up project:
Added a calendar task on Friday at 10
I sent out the email this morning urging NAA attendees to sign up for mystery calls. We've had a few more than 20 sign up already. Avi is going to call those prospects to keep them warm by asking things like "Why did you pick these specific properties?" and just generally finding out more about their phone culture. He will tee up a phone conversation for the weeks before NAA and/or set a firm appointment for NAA. The latter is obviously better, so the ultimate goal is a conference appointment.
Larry Van Tuyl and Dan Mattox will be in our office on Tuesday, June 16.

I want to give them a flavor of some key projects we're working on. I always want them to be exposed to the great people we have at CI. Rather than planting them in our lame conference room for the entire afternoon, we'll move them around the office to sit with various people for 10 minute blocks.
@Jackie / Jayah - Do you see any problems with turning those HCATs on for those accounts?  AND can you please send me screen shots of what that would look like in CM reporting??

The screen shots are the last piece I need to email Ashley and get this moving while the opportunity is still hot.
Mike - do we expect to see many more of them? What's the scoop from DS?
@Avi - Do you think you could use rentbuzz.com/CRISP on the phone by inviting prospects who object due to a phone skills related reason to take the analysis? 
The lag for hcat 7 has been very low all week. Mission accomplished.

This was a good exercise on how to attack a problem category.
Nathan, can you take the lead on figuring out why our office Internet is capped at such a small percentage of our available bandwidth?
I've seen some Dilawri launches come in through DealerSocket recently.  

That's awesome.  Why so awesome?  They are the largest auto group in Canada with 52 stores.  That's a big deal.

The purpose this thread is nothing more than to make sure we're aware of the name, brand, and opportunity that Dilawri represents.  

I know there have been several cases and projects on this topic. We need a reliable way to tag a dealership phone code as either Car Wars or Service Setter. Currently we have too many agents who are tagged to both departments. This results in meaningless reports and unnecessary Humanatic expenses.

Ian, can you provide a quick summary of how the current assignments are made. Also mention the efforts you've made up to this point to resolve.
anyone in the office can do it. just take an ethernet cable plug it into the switch and the other end into the laptop, turn off the wifi on the laptop and do a speedtest by going to speedtest.net
What's the next step to do the router check you mentioned?
Car Wars and Humanatic apps should be back up and working.
Callmeasurement will be taken down on 6/10/2015 @ 10pm CST for database repairs. Expected time of completion 30 min - 1 hr. 
  
One possibility is that the switch or router is the bottleneck.   When we first set up the network we found that we were only getting 20 when we should have been getting 100.  The wifi guy had to change a router configuration so that we got 100.   It's possible that the setting got reversed somehow.(it's interesting that we appear to peak at about 20mbps).   Plugging into the network wired and doing a speed test could confirm this theory.

Granted, non-steaming-http is not a very high bandwidth protocol and it's possible that there is no bottleneck but we aren't actually using all of our bandwidth.
I've had a few LL calls come in and "drop" immediately. I cannot hear recoding.  What's the cause? It can't be because someone else is claiming cause I'm answering immediately?? 

I've been receiving voicemails for some as well. Is that supposed to happen? 
I'll get it built this morning.
I'm more interested in learning why we're not using 80% of our current bandwidth. Do we have something configured improperly?
Is it possible to get it hosted on rentbuzz.com/CRISP as well?
@Reid, do you want a case or anything to do that redirect?
Reid did a redirect on the CW one to make carwars.com/crisp work because it has to do with the domain manager. 
That is great.
It's this.
rentbuzz.com/CRISP still directs to the Car Wars page. 
If you are going on an on-site, please chat me the date & city you are going to asap. I will be sending a more detailed email to corporate so he can intro us to the GM's and hopefully make the planning process easier for you guys.

For example: "Seattle - June 15"
Sweet. Another coup. 

Will we start to be included in those e-blast, to get a flavor of what others are doing?
Here is the explainer doc I've sent to them.

I may need to adjust it now that they are looking to get different area code numbers provisioned. (For example: the BDC is in Charlotte so ring-to's will be 704, but they will sometimes need 904 area code numbers for OB caller ID's for stores in other cities that they handle calls for).
The AC calling the GM should say, "Based on our experience, we would recommend having Lead Tag reach out to conduct a short, 1-on-1 training with your team members."
@BP and MikeH, could you do a 30 minute ACU training for us on this? The audience is all accts folks (and anyone else who wants to join)


Mondays at 2pm.


What about June 22?

We definitely need to add another hco. Regardless if it's a couple or lot, if they aren't service related we'll need a clear option for those non-service calls. 
@Jackie we should get the functionality setup like we have with E-Lead. With the E-Lead summary post, we can configure work note shares in the XXML shares tool. With DS it has to be done manually on the back end database. Jian should be able to match the same setup.
http is not a particularly expensive protocol bandwidthwise.   I have been very impressed with how well the south dallas office has been performing given their small bit of bandwidth.

I don't think the north dallas office needs to increase it's bandwidth to support the added VoIP traffic.
I think the largest problem here is they can't provision phone numbers by area code/rate center within the CW platform. 
A couple calls doesn't bother me. A huge percentage of sales calls would make think something we put in place isn't working.

We forced phone codes, so there may be people in the CW Service phone code class that want to make a call and are just making every call on an outbound line. What do reviewers generally mark these non-service calls as? Do we need to add another HCO?

Are they going to call sometime today?  Our hours of operation for this client is 7am - 5pm CST.
Pricing... good catch.  Revised:


100 Calls:  $281


200 Calls:  $521


300 Calls:  $761
I've reached out to DealerSocket to escalate this piece. We'll make sure it's a priority.

The number that they can call is 855.902.4231.
A lot of the calls on HCAT 83 are not service calls, there are a couple sales calls and some weird others that aren't service, for example on one call the agent called to wish someone a happy birthday.
I'll load 5 from Bel Red Energy Solutions to CD-3005-Lilburn
STX - Arlington Matlock-STX - E. Main: Alex M will take this. 
With the pending shift to move our phone traffic from cell coverage to VoIP, I asked Jack about our options for expanding bandwidth. He reached out to Level 3. Our guy came back and pointed out that today we're only using a small percentage of our current allotment. 

What's going on?
Cool, thanks.  I'll schedule an in person meeting with them, with the premise being to discuss new programs available (PST) and their current pricing package.
Dan, The bundle pricing needs to be revised. The two hundred calls saves them $1 from buying two sets of 100 but the 300 calls costs them more money than buying 3 sets of 100 calls.
I think this is a message that is on point and would resonate across a variety of media.  

"Don’t lose sight of the forest for the trees"
Dan what is the cost for normal outbound? $1.85 a minute?
We've run into another account today that has an in-house training planned for Friday. When we call the GMs, can we give them the options: 1) We can call each of your salesmen. It'll take 2 minutes and then they're good to. or 2) Have them schedule an in-house training and then the ACs do a follow up to make sure they actually did it. 
ok, Ross and I will knock these out. 
This is a really cool tool, good find, Kaiti.

@sales guys, would this be more powerful or do we need to keep it to simply a PDF?  
I don't have a tablet
Yes, give me just a second to get that.
Sarah, that's correct. 

We're racing to get all calls through Humanatic within 27 minutes. This change escalates the timing of when the call summary category hits a reviewer.
@Laura, seems like a press release would be better, and specifically directed (emailed) to the reporter as well. 
Justin, Mike, and Kyle --

Discuss possible locations that might work for a CI outpost office. I'm interested in a cheap spot that can host our Colorado people + the Dallas folks who want to live/work in Colorado for a spell.
I've only seen one new email about sales calls in these service hcats. <br><br>Felix, would you mind jumping in and listening to some calls in both categories?<Br><BR>[83] Outbound service call purpose<br>[84] Outbound invitation result
Springhurst Hills Dentistry -STX - Abrams: Joseph will take these. 5 Calls. 
Jardin already had a TC open for Bryan Easler, so if you need help with any other clients - let me know! 
@Dan, can you get me the number they can call that will reach Lead tag for the secret shopper call?
Smile Workshop - Denton-Spanaway Family Dentistry : Rebecca will load these. Total: 5
Roselle Park Dental-Serenity Dental Florida: Jacob Small will load
White Labeling: Josh, if we did a white label deal with these guys, would Lead Tag be able to work directly with their offices?  We would just introduce ourselves as The Wellness Hour's call center rather than Lead Tag.  It gets really complicated if I can't work directly with the offices and have to work through The Wellness Hour.
Ok, cool.  


Secret Shopper Call:  I can do a secret shopper call contingent upon two things... (1) The guy calling cannot actually set an appointment and (2) they call the direct line that rings straight to Lead Tag rather than a tracking line that rings through Dental Crown's bridge.  I don't want it to be recorded in Dental Crowns account.  



After Hours:  I'm open to the conversation but still hesitant to go outside of 7am - 6pm CST.  Lead Tag is undergoing quite a bit of transition right now.  Also, we have steady flow of qualified leads that want to use us for inbound/regular working hours.  My vote - Let's give them our pricing and then gather more information (when we would need to staff, call volume, the complexity of the job, etc.).  








I learned this from Mary.  Konrad is working on a case to fix it, I'll look for the case again.
I think that's a good way to position it initially...

"We've added a lot to PP since you first started like x, y, and z.  We'd like to discuss getting you on a package that's representative of those expanded capabilities but still recognizes Jefferson as one of those partners that helped us get PP started.  We're charging $399 today for new clients.  We'd propose moving Jefferson from $199 to $299."

As a plan B if they balk (entirely possible), I'd go after PST with a combo rate of $349 (floor of $299).  
I know this is supposed to be a physical one pager, but if in the future there is the possibility to create a webpage for this content, it may be a good opportunity to use this tool (going along with what Matt just suggested).
they were, sorry that comment was from a frustrated yesterday morning.  Thanks Bryan.  
App CFCs should be converted over to tag-based queries. I'm starting my tests to make sure they're all functioning normally.
@Jackie, yes, we could conceivably cut down on that time some by streamlining the process that checks for emails and running it more frequently. We could likely also cut down on the execution time of lead launch events once the data is processed - the biggest problem is that the email process can be rather slow depending on the number of emails in the queue, and each time we run that file we have to check the mail server to see if any new leads have come in. We'll need to update how the email pop file functions somehow to speed things up here.
I'm free whenever. Just grab me when you are.
I do not.
Hey guys, you've probably noticed that our call detail issues were solved yesterday.

In addition, the dev team has a quick turn project to get the wizard back on. That said, due to all of the issues in discovery sign up and the wizard being off for a week, please reach out to ensure that users know how to login and have their autotrader.com number. Most of these accounts have zero minutes, so the most important thing is to get that number on autotrader.com and make sure the user can login.

By the way, if you do notice the wizard, do not proceed on any of his steps. Doing so will move him to the next step for the client also, and the client will miss steps. 
Project created for this
This is awesome. Let's do the open mic idea at our million minute party for sure.<br>

Ryan and Jay, let's get started with planning this!

@Maggie- Issues should be resolved with yesterday's fixes. Please test/confirm.
@Lauren, Tyler, Ryan - Do any of you have a tablet we could use?
Maybe we could do a number of examples.  Start with a line like, "Getting a snap shot of all your calls is like..."

Then show examples of what only seeing half of something can end of meaning.

A beautiful car, but only the front half.  The whole car reveals a busted rear-end

And other examples that I have yet to think of, but you get the idea.
@Lauren, it shouldn't take long, but let's huddle quickly and see where all we want to change these. I guess that Free Demo form won't even be on the home page (or others) and every CTA on the site will go to Discovery? But let's run through them quickly this morning if you two can.
"A link in the Admin area of CallMeasurement that provides a simple spreadsheet of all current numbers in the CARFAX account and all numbers currently shared. It would only need to include the number plus label1, label2, and label3."

That data comes from: 

a.) Shared by the Vendor Insert Tool

b.) Actually in the CARFAX account


So all that other functionality you spoke of managing what's in the daily files and stuff is a no, correct?

<p>On this day in history, Secretariat won the Triple Crown. (1973) This year's Triple Crown winner, American Pharoah, was the 6th fastest time in Belmont history, but Secretariat's time of 2:24.00 is the best in history and almost 3 seconds faster than this year's winner.  A necropsy showed that Secretariat's heart was about 2.75 times the size of a normal horse heart. </p>
Intro paragraph per Dan's request:

Hi, I'm looking for salesmen Sally. ____ Hi Sally! This is Cam from Car Wars, your call tracking provider. How are you? The reason I'm calling is because I want to give you a heads up on a change that effects the way you handle incoming phone calls. Now, I know that you rarely handle inbound calls because of the way your BDC is set up, but this will still be really important to know for that one time you do handle an inbound call. Do you have about 2 minutes to talk? *goes into training*
REmember Lead Tag,  lets load from accounts that have not had 2 calls coached yet for the month.  And only 1 not 5.  This has been a short commercial break.  carry on
Just to confirm -- this is just a change in how calls are routed to try and speed up those store that have call summaries?

Not that every account with CW pro account will have some version of call summaries. 
Project: 
Cool. Here's the project to go live.
@Sam, definitely the intention. Lets definitely start swapping the CTA out as soon as possible
@Jay, I haven't heard this. Are there cases or another board?
I think we should just flip it live. Even if the user doesn't know his login, he'll still be able to create a new one to gain access. This is a nice step for us.
@Justin, authentication testing is complete for individual calls from eLEAD, VIN, and Dealersocket. How should we communicate this change to the CRMs before flipping live? Or do we generally just flip live? 
This is awesome!

Agreed...a good analogy to emphasize how misleading a subset (snapshot) of the complete picture can be.  
Great articles. I heard great things about this guy when he was with the Cards. I was pissed when they lost Jocketty, but he just couldn't coexist.

If we hadn't, we'd probably be hamstrung by Pujol's contract. Instead we have the best record in baseball with a young complimentary team.

The Cards with would be an interesting personnel analogy for CI. A couple of key veterans (Peralta, Holliday, Wainwright, etc. . .) surrounded by youth. They actually have some age/injury challenges this year, but its largely been "next up."

I would argue that they have the most sustained success using this approach.
@Dan, they will need to see us in action. It looks bad if we won't let them do a secret shopper call. Especially since they will be referring us to people. 
My other concern is that we could lose the business all together if we don't do the out of hour calls. This is there main business, not the call center piece. They maybe willing to still work with us but it could be a deal breaker.

Great news.  
Welcome email (please read), note the login info for their website (to learn more)
We've just been approved to be a member of the Plumbing, Heating, Cooling Contractors (PHCC) Assn.  It's the oldest and largest HVAC related trade org in the US with ~3,500 members.

I'm attaching a couple of docs to review:<br>
- Email that I got with basic intro.. links (access info) to their website.<br>
- last year's version of the who's who directory.. LOTS of good contacts here (all of their partners, and all of the heads of the state chapters)<br>

Review their Website, and the attached doc and bring yourselves up to speed on these folks.  As you'll see, there's an opportunity here for us to participate freely in forums, create our own blog (akin to what we can do with Svc Roundtable)
<br>
We'll look to get "launched" (by way of an email blast through them), or our own email out to members ASAP (hoping for a spot in July)<br>

Their National Trade Show takes place 9/28 in Orlando, FL.<br>
@Matt, we'll want to get signed up for this.<br>

I will be working to transition a lot of the day to day stuff to Mary Jo, after we finish getting the table set and our plan of attack ready to fully leverage our membership with these folks.<br>

We'll talk some more about this in our team meeting later this week.
@Laura, I forgot to mention that there are a number of reporters that are planning to attend the Kelsey event this coming Friday.  Not many but well known ones, e.g. Forbes, WSJ, Buzz Feed and a crew from the SF CBS affiliate.  

The attached list has email and phone numbers.  I would be appropriate, I think, to let them know that they MUST listen in to the Panel that Reid's chairing at 940am!

Link to show home page with agenda and more details below!
I don't know if we'd even need an actual snapshot from a competitor.  Everyone using competing products knows they are only getting some of their calls monitored, or paying a fortune to get them all listened to.  I think we should do something not even related to calling, just something super funny that shows how inaccurate a snapshot can be.
I just learned that we currently have no working DS integration for Call Summaries coming into their work notes.  Any idea when this will be fixed?  Can we prioritize this?  I've sold 4, with a 5th about to come through, using that functionality as the crux of the sale.
This is a great chance to pitch without formally pitching.  Whether Casee likes it or not, these stores will inevitably be asking how / what do we do?

* No surprise here: Start with a story.   You lose the group entirely with a boring intro.  Chances are they will have sat through 10 other presentations.  What makes you special enough to not check my phone?

* I like the simple approach of CRISP but make sure to weave stories in / out.  For example: With Connect, don't just dive right into what it technically means.  Instead, use a story about the typical shopper experience that leads to a phone call.  Shopper Steve hops online (show a local dealer's website). Then Shopper Steve reads reviews (show a local dealer's Dealer Rater page with the face of one of the ISMs).  Then Shopper Steve goes to AutoTrader (show a local dealer's AutoTrader page). Relate it to these guys by talking about their marketing, their own customer experiences.  THEN! Shopper Steve calls and gets a voicemail.  After all that shopping and expensive marketing too!

* Now that I think about....can you just make this hypothetical "Shopper Steve" your narrative the entire time?  Relate everything back to the shopping experience of our Hero Shopper Steve.  Then weave in / out examples and relate it back to these guys personally. 

* The Google Doc is good for the content and training but you need something like Shopper Steve to make it interesting.  

* Bad news: It's much much easier to avoid a good interesting narrative



    
Update:

Jashona had successful tests with signup for Buzzgratis today, but many of us are seeing errors. It seems that we are completing the account AND sending the user the new account emails, but we are getting an oops message on the error page. Basically, our process is working, but we are not displaying the right confirmation page to the user. Jashona is still troubleshooting. 
Last week we cleared out 83 and 84, and again made sure Service Setter outbound lines had them.

Because only calls from agents in the Car Wars service phone code class should go down these HCATs, we shouldn't see many sales calls. I know that was a problem before.

I'm curious if we are seeing an improvement in that area. Are there less sales calls in 83 and 84 as of our change on Thursday/Friday?
Yes, Scott is pretty amazing!
@Cam - Along those same lines... We should think through how to intro the call to sales agents.  I think it's worth stating to the sales agents that this will be a rare event but if it does happen, we want you to (1) know what the purpose of the chimer is and (2) how to claim the call.  


We can chat tomorrow morning on a good way to frame the training.
Absolutely
Project: display call summary in CX details
Is our current process functional enough to get by? Even if it's not ideal, is it good enough to limp through another month or so while we focus on other projects?

Scroll to the bottom!
Continue to reach out to the GM's.

@Cam -- lets continue to try to train the sales staff. I would like them trained for the rare occasion that they do hear the chimer on a call.
@Sarah, yes, we currently tell clients that it is from 8am-8pm Monday through Saturday.

<i>Do you know for sure if we stop the LL call when an OB call has already been made to that customer number?
Is the only concern that 10 min time frame between when a lead comes in and call is generated? I imagine if someone calls them during that time we won't stop the LL call?</i>

Yes, we know that for sure. It removes it from the que. Likewise, even if a call happens in that 10 minute time frame, it is removed.

@Ian, as for the time it takes to get place the call, is this because we are only checking to see if we got an email at certain intervals?
Interesting.  My thoughts...


1.  I'm not really interested (yet) in doing call center jobs outside of normal business hours.  


2.  I'm definitely interested in the inbound client for 6 locations that they have for business hours


3.  Outbound pricing:  1.85/minute is our OB pricing.  I'm good with doing a flat rate pricing that would look something like this...


<b>100 calls at $271</b> (1.85/min at 1.5 min talk time)

<b>200 calls at $541</b> (1.85/min at 1.5 min talk time)

<b>300 calls at 831</b> (1.85/min at 1.5 min talk time)



4.  Inbound pricing:  72 cents/min plus 12 cents/minute for call tracking and recordings.  I would just quote him 84 cents/minute.



5.  Before signing a contract, we still have some work to do.  What are the goals of the calls?  How will we set up appointments?  Etc.  


6.  I don't wan to do referrals just yet because for reasons that I stated in our offline conversation.


7.  I don't really like the idea of having them call through the Dental Crown bridge either.  









I was able to reach all of my accounts except for Hendrick BMW Northlake
@ Nathan - There has been a lot added to the platform itself since they signed up.

- Outbound report and listening to OB calls to determine if they were booked. <br>
- 4 Enterprise reports <br>
- The ability to get a plethora of automated reports via email.  They could only receive a daily email of appointment opps numbers prior to the addition of these. <br>
- The ability to self audit calls <br>
- Click to Call <br>
- The dialer <br>
- Lead Box <br>
- The ability to build and manipulate schedules and bridges on their own <br>
- The new support form <br>
- HCAT changes to include better break out of reasons not booked and a new section that reports why not connected. <br>
- Call Center & Clinic staff break outs <br>
- Call Center Coached Calls pod <br>
- Updated, more intuitive platform

The pending one was sent to the old PO Box. New invoices will have our Dallas address.
What about core features of PP that have evolved over time as we further developed the platform (not things that would trigger additional charges)?  

Short of those, feels like one where we build a story around PST and a special rate for them to take advantage of by bringing their total package to $299-349, while clearly articulating that most pay $449.  
@Reid - Do you know, are they still sending to address on invoice, or are they going to send to our office address this time? 
Josh Nailed it.  The AADGP and the Mastery Company Summit we just attended appear to be great opportunities and the indiviual offices are slowing starting to catch onto the call center phenomenon.  There are a ton of Individual office targeted conferences.

+ Ryan Pitz - he has a list of events that target individual offices. 
@Dan, There are 3 conferences a year for DSOs. Two have smaller ones and the third has a few smaller ones. <br>

There are probably a lot of single dental offices out there that could use lead tag. It is just a matter of getting in front of them. There are plenty of large dental conferences that would put you in front of these. 
Couple of question for Kelly, Josh and Keaton - 



Do you guys go to/know of conferences that are geared towards smaller DSO's?  


Are there other ways/avenues for Carl and I to explore in order to connect with smaller DSO's?



Back story - Josh King went to a Dental Conference this pas week.  It was specifically geared for small DSO's or individual offices who wanted to become a DSO.  He said that he had a handful of people inquire about a Call Center.  


Most individual offices don't need a call center.  



Most large DSO's already have a call center.



A good niche for Lead Tag could be partnering with small DSO's with 1-5 stores.  We're doing that with Dental Crown and about to start with Sturgeon Dental (pending signed contract).  



  




Updated due date: June 17th. Y'all still have over a week for this. Please pull in whoever you need to help get this done by next Wednesday. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks! 
Got it Justin.

@Mike, 

Question I chatted you but didn't realize you were OOO:


"Why are we building out the option for single line provisioning when we basically already have that functionality in call measurement, the bulk makes sense  but maybe i'm missing something from the single provision that isn't already provided?"
Sounds awesome
@ PE - Any features added were while I was already involved so I have been careful to make sure that they pay for them all.  Unfortunately, we have no leverage based on features added.

They have added custom reports that they paid for, they have added call summaries that they pay for, and offices, that they pay for.... that's it.
Last Wednesday we had a payout of $680 for 136 referrals which were each paid manually. 
I know a lot of our reviewers actively use the referral program, and each week there is a pretty lengthy list of new bonuses to pay out. Mayra could probably provide better details for this, since she is the one that is making these payments every Wednesday. 

We were also going to begin using the program to push more free advertising, by having bloggers take advantage of it. 

Call Summaries at $89 per location - they agreed to the call center only.  It is in their invoice already.

They did have a 1 time fee of 7000ish (already paid in December) for a custom report: Spanish v English filtering.

All other items we built on their behalf we specifically said they wouldn't pay for it because we built them for all PP users.

Kelly, this is a fine line that I never wanted to cross.  I've always just told myself that the Jefferson relationship is worth whatever they are paying because they are the launching pad for Patient Pursuit.  They launched us into Heartland which we also used as a launching pad (paying 3.75 cents per minute).  I have zero talent at telling a client to start paying more.
If anyone is a talented rapper I'll volunteer my services as a hype man (jump around on-stage and occasionally yell into the mic) while I'm here over the summer
How critical is the referral program? I'm not asking with any implied skepticism; I just haven't followed the results.
All Car Wars accounts that are currently on hcat 57.
For now do callbox.dialtag.com
The screenshots from their Dealersocket Integration indicate Rick Case is setup with their integration.  

Maybe Hammond had the Dealer wrong.
Jane - I just saw that sub-contracted list for NAA offer, no go on that.  But by all means use the 2014 and the 2015 lists we've paid for to launch the campaign on all fronts.

LinkedIn and Email

I doubt it. CR is already touting around a 4 page doc of screens shot of their new full DS integration. 
Haeg is verifying with Hammond. 
Are we thinking now that we were mistaken regarding the improved Call Revu integration? 
Can you work with Keaton to document all of the added features since their original deal was agreed to?

My strong suspicion is the they are not paying for quite a bit. Then we can just gently explain why a price increase is necessary to maintain their current set up and give options to downgrade.
Gary took Kids Arlinglon, Kids Burleson, Kids Mansfield, Hillard, and ID Eastridge.
@RW

Any preference here:

http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/oproject_manage.cfm?pid=69839
This is a cool idea and something I think we can deal with.  Do we have any idea of what these snapshots look like?  I know we can fake whatever, but going off an original is always the preferred.    

Adding some people that will make this bad ass.  


Super interesting stuff.
Matt,

On our sales call Friday, the sales team discussed coming up with a cool one-pager that shows the difference between a shapshot (like the snapshot of calls that the competition provides because they don't review every call) and the overall view that we give customers at CI.

We've all seen unflattering photos of people caught mid blink that distort how they actually look.  We could compare this to how it's wrong to rely on snapshots of your call data when trying to get an accurate assessment of performance.

I've attached a great photo of Michelle Obama ready to rip the head off of something.  Maybe she was really that mad.... 
This.  Is.  Awesome.
Which accounts will go through this new summary hcat (after testing): all accounts on Car Wars Pro, or only accounts that currently have HCAT 57?
New team to support Demolition

I already have personnel in mind, so I'm not seeking applications for this team. The purpose of this thread is to create an initial outline for what we're doing.
I want some people pounding the data to figure out things like:

1. How often should SDRs be calling a semi-qualified prospect?

2. How soon should SDRs call a high-funnel prospect?

3. How should we score and qualify leads to optimize conversion?

4. What characteristics are most critical to a successful field sales rep at CI?

5. Which Product Marketing campaigns produce the best ROI?

6. What are the economics on in-person prospect visits? When is /
isn't it justified?

7. What's the performance difference between a consulting touch from a Lead Tag agent versus a consulting touch from an AC?

8. What event should trigger an AC to place an upsell call to a dental office manager?

9. What's the best messaging sequence (email, Lead Box, banners, call,
etc.) for an upsell campaign?

10. How can we eliminate the costly no-shows that plague our AEs?

"But isn't all of this stuff that Nathan, Toni, and others should be doing?" Their hands
are completely full with managing people, recruiting, and supporting their teams' day-to-day efforts. From the other boards (linked below), think about the structure of the 49ers and Astros. Nathan and Toni are the coaches who are managing the players in the heat of the game. This new team is our Nerd Cave front office that is responsible for feeding the coaches everything they need for a competitive edge.
That's why I need to see the request.
Ongoing development of the Demolition platform:

Related idea: Red Ventures
Related: Astros

Related: Meat Space (follow the linked threads within)

Our new Demolition platform will be our in-house version of Inside Sales, Hubspot, Ambition, and the Disney magic wand. Our roster is full of great people who are ready to generate leads, pursue prospects, close deals, grow accounts, and upsell new revenue.

We're creating a new team to operate in between the Demolition data and the various groups (marketing, sales, accounts, call center) that will be using it.
Conference Room 2 (the one at the end of the hall on the right) at 3pm.  

Boom.
I spoke with Cassie today, and she had an extended conversation with Becca last week.

They love Call Drip. Greg Hammond likely got Call Drip confused with CallRevu. 

Dealersocket built out an integration with Call Drip. 

Becca is confusing Car Wars review time and Lead Launch delay time. With that said, their favorite thing about Call Drip is the they show up in under a minute. We need to get our times down.

There is probably a play to get a pilot of Lead Launch in there and work through that to Car Wars, but we need to be tight.

They get all the commodity call tracking through their internal phone system. We'll have to win this with everything else we do.
Yes. I believe so.
@Toni

Are they free at 3pm tomorrow?
Woops, I just split Lauren into two people.   Scratch Taylor, add Mackenzie
@Kelly, Lauren, Taylor - would you 3 please assist MiKing with this ongoing project?  He will inform you of a time tomorrow to discuss.
Those efforts should remain. This is just a behind-the-scenes change on how we execute call summaries.
What does our SLA with L3 allow for? Surely it is a whole lot less than 2% of calls.
@Duck - Cassie would like to get a couple of stores on this as soon as it is ready.
Well, Clint beat everyone to being the first of your class to sign up for Friday Wrap auditions next week. Who else can I sign up?
Your help with this is very <b> VERY </b> appreciated.  
Need to trim this down.  How long does it take for Dealersocket calls?
I will attach a link to a google doc where you can record:

1. The url to the Craig's List ad <br>
2. The url to the company website <br>
3. The url to any relevant LinkedIn profile for the company or for a likely decision maker.
For those who don't know, there is a CI band, okay, maybe not "CI" band.. But everyone in the band works at CI. A few are at LeadTag, so don't leave them out! :D
ProTips:

Most of these positions are found under "jobs" or "gigs" in various cities.

College towns seem to have the most.

Searching "call centers" with the quotes is useful.


Local moving forward.  


@Ian, it looks like the calls generate about 10 minutes later which isn't where we want it but also could be worse! Do you know for sure if we stop the LL call when an OB call has already been made to that customer number?<br>

 Is the only concern that 10 min time frame between when a lead comes in and call is generated? I imagine if someone calls them during that time we won't stop the LL call?<br>


@Justin, reported response time is key for them. Is this going to mess with their response time "scores" if contact is 10 min later?


But Miking, where do we find them?

Well, it turns out many of them live on Craig's List looking for agents for said call centers! 

<a href="http://austin.craigslist.org/csr/5034366035.html">Like this</a>

<a href="http://austin.craigslist.org/csr/5052856613.html">And this</a>

<a href="http://dallas.craigslist.org/ndf/sls/5064428380.html">And even this</a>
Already on it, sir! 

I'll submit some cases with Jackie for that.... We'll be able to change the hcat answers will be easy; however, a change with call summaries won't happen as quickly 
Sorry guys, I checked my phone and did not receive a call Sunday. I thought I had but maybe it was the Saturday calls and this morning's call. I am delirious.<br>

Saturday is a big day and makes sense to leave on.<br>

Are we simply going to tell clients "It's on from 8 am - 8 pm Mon-Sat. This is how it works and we can't customize it"?<br>

What if a dealer wants it on Sunday or for some reason does not want it on Saturday?


Call Box makes it easy to organize the outbound calling efforts for these folks!  Seriously, we can solve a very real problem for them.

The trick is finding these people so we can get our message to them.
Today's ideal Call Box customer profile: <br>
1. Outbound only <br>
2. Small (1-10 agents) <br>
3. Brand new or relatively new <br>
4. Functioning as a lead follow up or cold calling site <br>
5. Probably has no clue how to organize or run a call center but recognizes there is value in pushing phone calls
It's not the accounts that's possibly wrong; it's the user accounts. Even after they're created, you can't log into the account (sometimes). The accounts are set up with no access whatsoever.
In light of that, I'll also pause any initiatives/projects we have to upsell call summaries for Pro, as everyone on Pro (and hproduct 1) will have them, and hcat 57 won't be an option anymore.

We'll tweak but keep upsell initiatives for call summaries for other Discovery and Essentials. 
In this case, can you ask for an API request example?
That's reserved for saxophone players, the OGs of the Kenny Gs
It's so useful, that I can no longer hold back the excitement of getting this out to market.  (this sounds like it could be sarcastic, but it's not)


Who's looking for a Frontman?
What that capture any request they make moving forward or would we be able to check on how they did it before? PureCars isn't going to set up any new accounts unless they know they can do it correctly 
I just added log to new_site_create.cfm (the API used for provision sub accounts). Let's see what's the request they are sending.
The Avi is best saved for Vegas. 
Call Box, while only about 27% built out, is already doing really cool things.

As it stands today, Call Box is a very useful all-in-one tool for managing outbound call centers.

Just ask Lead Tag.
@Matt - No deliverables from me other than connect on LinkedIn. There are no phone numbers, so we can't release the Avi. 
<a href="https://cfsummit.adobeevents.com/schedule/sessions">https://cfsummit.adobeevents.com/schedule/sessions</a>

Correct; this will be for Pro only.
I've heard from Curtis that the way they've provisioned sub accounts is incorrect. PureCars would like the documentation on how to correctly mass-provision sub accounts in the future.

Is the method they used previously the best way to do it considering our API limitations, or is there a better way to set up these accounts?
PureCars queries our API to create a huge amount of sub accounts. Whenever they're created, the labels are listed as "NULL"
Thanks Jane - outside of LinkedIn and setting meetings. We don't need to do anything further with this list?
I already have email communication going with this list of course, I just wanted you guys to have this resource. 
Hows this going? I saw that y'all were able to get if they were current clients or not. <br><br>Have you tried checking to make sure they were still the correct contact at each dealership, and if not then updating the name? And getting email/linkedin URL? <br><br>If you have any questions at all please let me know today or tomorrow as I am OOO Wed-Fri. <br><br>Thanks guys! 
Here are options I have thought of.

Call Center gets on a package of 13c per minute. <br>
- $1,400 more in monthly revenue from them.

All offices increase to a $299 package (still giving them a big discount and still giving them the call center for free).<br>
- $6,351 more monthly

I sell them on Phone Skills.<br>
- $6,854 more monthly<br>
*but not guaranteed they will do it, roll out will likely be very slow, and price is so close to current price they may think it's not worth it.

All offices increase by $100 p/month (still giving them a big discount and still giving them the call center for free).<br>
- $4,600 more monthly<br>
*I see this as a negotiation step down after telling them we need to increase them to $299.

I sell them on Professional Services, having a Dental Dental consultant for $X a month.
Depending on what they request that include.  I see that running about $500 - $2,000 dollars a month.  Again, not a guaranteed sale.

Is this something we have done before?  Gone to an account and said, we need to update your pricing package?  Any advice or thoughts here are helpful.
A list of attendees is attached.

If yall need any extra musicians I can pretty much fill in the gap anywhere needed. 
The Wellness Hour is a marketing company that does infomercials for physicians such as dentists. They are wanting a call center to partner with who will handle all of the calls generated from these infomercials and schedule the appointments. 

These infomercials generally air early or late around 5:30 am or 11:00 pm. They can get us the schedule of these infomercials so that we can be staffed while they air. They are also likely to get us clients who will use our call center to handle normal hour calls which are not generated from infomercials. They have one that is ready to sign on now. This potential client has 6 locations. Due to the shortage of calls they may get, we could set a price such as $200 or the minute rate, whichever is greater. This will cover us.<br>

They want inbound pricing and outbound pricing (including the cost of the call tracking part). I told them 86 cents a minute and 74 cents if they get high volume, but since they will be selling our service, I think we should come at them with 74 cents a minute plus 8 cents for call measurement. <br>

They have tossed around white labeling us, but the CEO stated he would prefer that he uses the call center as an "outsourced piece" where he sets the prices, and then we bill them and kick back The Wellness Hour a certain amount.  I told them that the way we do it is give them a percentage. To keep it clean as possible, I think white labeling would be best. <br>

They want to charge their clients a flat rate each month plus 99 cents a minute. <br>

What they requested from us by today if possible:<br>
-Pricing for outbound calls that we would do for them. These are 1-2 minute calls to offices <br>
-They want pricing in bundles of 100, 200, and 300. <br>
-Inbound Pricing<br>
-2 clients numbers they can call to reach our call center. They want to "secret shopper" them to see our teams performance.<br>
-1 client they can call for a reference. <br>

@Dan, They want to move ASAP. Let's get the pricing done ASAP with them and then finalize the details later.
Jefferson Dental Clinics is a very discounted pricing package of $159 p/office and the Call Center for free.

They have held this price since December 2013

Average minute usage is across their 46 offices is about 2600 minutes.  Their Call Center did 11,000 minutes last month.

Their last bill was $7403 for 131,437 minutes giving us about 5.6c per minute.

I want to increase their package price.  Does anyone have any suggestions for how to approach that conversation?

I play(ed) guitar and am actually selling two guitars if anyone wants to take them off my hands.

@Ryan

Rocking is all I know.
Yesssss. My day has been made.
Miking, you rock
I changed it like 15 min ago Paige! 
ha! Sorry for posting my second comment 3 times. But please don't over look the 1st one, as it has all of the background info in it.
Now that you have been proven wrong can you please change your pic? Kthx.
We are like T-Mobile.  When you don't use your monthly allowance, you get to carry over month-to-month.  So I had 4 unused mistakes in the bank from earlier this year.  
I thought their success was all about Nolan?
MiKing, this is 1 of your 2 allotted mistakes for the month....
Well snap.  I done learend something today.  
Great example!!  Notice that on the website I'm in a pink dress while on the portal my dress is black.  Two different photos.
Check your profile page... there are 3 different pictures you have to upload. One is client facing. The others are not.
It seems your excuses are not valid, sir.
False... 
Clients do not see your portal picture....
I would prefer to keep the photo that potential clients see more professional and less whatever that pic is.
Miking- New GoPortal pic ASAP. I want to see that during the Face Quiz!!
If we had weekly caption contests that pic would be a home run.
I've seen some reports of ICDC silencing the customer end of the call? Is that supposed to happen?  We'll need to exhaust/test anything today prior to the inevitable complaints that will occur on the call in the morning. 
hahahaha, please do Miking.  That picture is great!
Interesting postscript after these articles were published: the Astros position on Brady Aiken was proven valid. After the deal fell apart, Aiken went to the IMG Academy and blew out his elbow on his 12th pitch.
Extreme Moneyball
They're ahead of schedule:
I threw together an outline. It's pretty wordy right now (I copied and pasted a lot from the crisp docs) and has some pretty big gaps, but I just needed to start brain dumping to get this started. 

Things I would also like to include: Stats on Penske's IB connection rate and the change in OB call volume (and ave talk times) from Jan compared to May.

Any help/guidance on this would be greatly appreciated

Background:

Time: 45 min to 1 hr on wednesday 6/17 (time not set yet)

- Attendance: 20-25 stores will be sending their ISM/ISD, I assume there will prob be 15-20 extra people sent as well. 

- Topic: Casee was originally wanting this just to be on OB best practices/tips and tricks, but I convinced her to make it 50/50 IB/OB by telling her about CRISP. 

- Content: Casee want's the focus on this training to be the importance of handling every phone call well: tips and tricks on IB and OB phone performance. Penske is still in the process of rebuilding their firm foundation. They Started with OB and starting to move towards IB. SO we are here to help give the managers/directors tips and tricks on getting their teams engaged and performing better. In Casee's words, this needs to be "Phone performance 101"



- No CarWars - only a few dealerships out of the whole group are on CWs, and she doesn't want anyone to be confused. boo.





Sorry to anyone I didn't get photos of!!  I know there were a few more of us out there.  Michael's dangerous boat rocking made me need to put the phone away.
@Ryan

This should be my new profile pic! 



Don't start MiKing.... Michael Tiff kept rocking the boat and trying to startle me. Phones and water don't typically mix

Great thumb Toni 

I'll take the last one Tomball


I actually know how to play 100 years by Five for Fighting! I have the sheet music hahaha.

I'll take Bryan Easler.

I will take Bommarito
Robb's right.

That's a playlist for reference, add it for afterhours brainstorming.
Please No Streaming.
Shamitka will load from Grace dental Smiles- Highland Oaks Family Dentistry 
I will load from First Impression Smile Center- Godel Family Dentistry 
Thanks for clarifying.  I don't believe that it'll come up as he was most interested in what we could do for THEM.. I'll keep you posted.
Rebecca will load from Family Dentistry Arlington- First eye care Weatherford  
Attendee List attached
Spotify Collab playlist for brainstorming:


A couple of updates on this event: <br>
** Location - it actually is closer to downtown SF than I'd thought.  It's a cab ride (of ~1.2 miles)<br>
** Attendee List (attached) It's small, but their are some high quality companies there that we have, or would like to, engage(d) with like Reach Local, Home Advisor, YP.  <br>

MJ, we'll discuss how we divide and conquer, and work to get Reid introduced before or after his pitch.  

@Reid, tell me again when your flight from SFO is on Friday.  I'd really like to get you introduced to the folks from Home Advisor at a minimum!  
Yes
Thanks. I'm aware that this effort is focused on Pro clients, or those on original Car Wars (hproduct 1, 12), but should we omit this from hproducts 10 and 11 (Discovery and Essentials)? 

When we've been making Car Wars changes lately, we apply them to every CW hproduct, so I want to make sure we know which ones we are applying these to.

My particular reason for asking about Essentials is because we intentionally omit appt. request and booked info for upsell purposes and I think this category will reveal that information.
Yes. I saw that in later post. I'm getting with l3 and Konrad to discuss
We run our servers at the same Level3 colo that hosts our telephony traffic. We're going to start moving to Amazon's cloud.
Can we just separately map a shorter, two variable pair to the full ID?

rvcll.com/?u=abjwh&v=xyhw

urlshort.var_u = 'abjwh'<br />
urlshort.var_v = 'xyhw'<br />
urlshort.frn_callid = 101102398324
If we do cover songs, here are some call-related ones:

Call Me Maybe - Blondie

Call Me - Blondie

You Can Call Me Al - Paul Simon

I Just Called To Say I Love You - Stevie Wonder

Crazy Little Thing Called Love - Queen

Cars - Gary Numan

Just What I Needed - The Cars

100 Years - Five For Fighting

And so forth
Reid, I met the VP, Global Mktg (Jeff Baumgarten) for Digital Realty on Friday.  Long story.  I'm going to have lunch with him on Weds of this week to take him through what we do.  They have a massive inside sales team and need help with QA (enter CI).  He's introduced me to the folks that run MarketSource as well (e.g. big sales outsourcing co). <br>

DLR's core biz are data centers.  I'm anticipating that he might ask me who our current colo partner is... who is it?  Are you open to learning more about what they have to offer?  LMK, as I want to be prepared, just in case.
Jane, will you move this into a campaign and start assigning tasks?  I can be the first task: Finalize template.

Thanks
We use "tenant" in our reporting.  We should change that.
This will replace the current hcat 57. Anyone on Car Wars will shift to the new hcat 143.
I don't know about the precise numbers in terms of how we define <i>recent</i>, and there are surely some duplicates in there...but Yeah. That number's legit. 
yes.
@Reid, will accounts that currently have HCAT 57 (call summaries) get both types of summaries?

My main reason for this question is to determine which default ax_report these users should get, but I also wonder what their call detail will now look like. 
Are these number provision requests both local and toll free?
Missed Op alerts have been turned back on!
Yeah, we should discuss with Lauren whether there are plans to edit the homepage to focus on Discovery. I imagine there are, but we can help accelerate.
(And not many clients are using it yet)
I can reach out to Dutch Miller.
It can't be custom for individual clients, so no, not right now until we see similar feedback from more clients.
Is there any way we could extend the date range for affectation return calls beyond 72 hours?
Those are the only 4 we need right now, so whoever doesn't get one can get the next.

Also, keep in mind that some of these accounts may have come in a  couple weeks ago, so don't set yourself up for someone to say "What do you mean you see that I just signed up? That was weeks ago." You may want to say that we've noticed they haven't had activity in their Discovery account. 
It would appear that contact names and contacts are in go portal for the accounts, but not the dealership phone number that we used for the ring to. 

Here's what I have from the Hubspot forms for the ring tos:

Tomball Ford: 2813513000

Bommarito: 3147319777

Dutch Miller: 3045292301

Bryan Easler: 8286937261
Okay,  I talked to Ashley at the Summit we just attended and it looks like Rachel has been a bit of barrier getting things moving forward (interesting info to have).  It seems as though Rachel is a gate keeper of sorts for CI and other Departments of Heartland like Heimdall of Asgard.

Anyways.  Ashley wants two questions answered for the Recruiting and Affiliations sub accounts (lskins - 18456 & 18455).<br>
HCAT 3 - Live Conversation <br>
HCAT 18 - Reason Not Connected 

I told her we could easily add those HCATs and it would likely be an extra 2c a min per HCAT we add so 4c more per min for those two sub accounts to have those two HCATs.

I need to send her the exact questions we'd be answering & what that would look like in her reporting.  I need a screen shot of how that displays in CM reporting?

I will also send her an agreement addendum to get the additional cost signed off on.
The following are accounts we need to reach out to while the wizard is off. Wait until tomorrow to reach out. It'll be good to see if we fix call details today before reaching out.

Dutch Miller Chevrolet: Monica may have attempted to reach these guys, but they have no minutes or activity, so I don't know if they have even given the number to autotrader (or have that number) or have logged in.

Bommarito Ford, Bommarito Honda, Bommarito Nissa, Bommarito VW (this is one account): This account has no data. I don't know if they have even opened the login or autotrader email, but they certainly have done nothing in the account.

Tomball Ford: There are two accounts for this because the guy submitted twice. No data in either. Pick one account and deactivate the other, but try to talk to the client first to make sure they haven't done anything with one of the accounts or numbers.

Bryan Easler (already assigned to Jardin): No data. 
Battle of the bands sounds great!
I'll be there!
@Reid, that's on OMG number.  My reference to 20K was the number that we've got in many a preso on how many active accounts we have.<br>

Let me get this straight.. in May (?) we had 1.1M unique users of our software in some way, shape or form, e.g. administrators, call center agents, etc..? <br>

Now THAT is a number that we should be talking about more!
Here is some more recent timing information for this process (there hasn't been much done to improve the processing speed for emailed leads yet) - received_datetime is the date/time at which the email was received by our account, date_Created is the date/time at which the event is processed, and date_executed is the date/time at which a lead launch call was executed

I actually played piano/took lessons for 11 years.  Pretty decent at it, if I say so myself!  Haven't played in a while though... hard to find a random piano laying around haha!
No musical talent to speak of, but I take some pretty killer photos and have experience taking photos at live shows if anyone is interested in that sort of thing.... :)
@Jackie, we don't have a process that stops the call if the call has been handled in DealerSocket, so yes, we execute the calls in that situation unless they called them via one of our tracking lines that day. 

We are not supposed to send calls on Sunday, period. There is an abort at the top of the execute page purely to prevent sunday calls - so long as the server knows what day it is, that shouldn't happen. Out of curiosity, can you give me some information on the call(s) you received on Sunday? I have no record of that occurring in the database... it says you received most of your calls on the 6th, and the next one is recorded as having occurred on the 8th
This is needed, thank you Monica! Going to go back through our marketing materials this week and clean them up so we don't have to keep washing our mouths out with soap. 
Thinking about something reusable. Like a dry-erase type 5x7 phone checklist. On the back it could have some tips and direct them to the performance pod to see their stats. 
<br>
<br>
A checklist could also be a pod in RB, but Monica and I shot that down because it seems like one more thing they have to have up on their computer. It would probably be utilized most if it's an offline tool. 
Yes- just forwarded it to you again in case you didn't get it!
@Allison

That's TBD. I imagine it will be mid July.
What is the due date for buying in?

Once we get the wizard operational again, we should revise the car wars homepage to funnel visitors towards the discovery signup page.
I've added a weekly calendar reminder to all active users' calendars to keep HS clean.  We've got a ton of stuff still in May.  Make a habit out of a weekly check to keep things updated.

okay, sounds good.
I'd be down for a battle of the bands!  I play lots of instruments.

For what it's worth: use the higher number whenever you can.

We have 1,131,332 active users. Rather than counting State Farm as one client, look at it as 27k users (that's how many people have pulled data from us across corporate and field offices).
Thank you for not leaving me hangin', Taylor. ;)
I would also help organize if needed
I think the standard cover song process would be fine.  Meet up, throw out song ideas, try out playing them, get a good crowd-serving selection of songs tailored for the people at CI, go home with the homework of knowing them all start-finish, then meeting a few times to practice together before we perform.

It would also be fun to write a CI song together and perform it.
GUILTY FEET HAVE GOT NO RHYTHM
Ion disappeared for jury duty last week. I'm still expecting some pushback on the invoice adjustment, but we haven't yet connected.

Our plan is to push forward with the $1,481 for Service Setter. It would be a huge help to notch a few more wins while corporate deliberates.
i'm never gonna dance again...
To hop off of what Toni and Jay were saying, having an open mic type of event for the next party would be awesome.

We could have a core band playing different stuff, and also have anyone else that wants to jump in the middle of the set to do their thing (singer/songwriter duets, sax solo, DJ, etc.).

I'd be happy to help organize something like that. It would take some work but would be an awesome way to showcase some talent. 
What songs will we be playing, and why will it be Careless Whisper repeated throughout the whole night?
I see the invoice went up.

@Reid - Have you received any response on SS or the price increase?

My plan is to use Bob's store and network as leverage to keep selling SS direct at $1,481 until we hear something about a group decision.
That sounds good, I can meet yall at the north dallas office.
Project: full cycle review widget
I've played guitar for a long time, if anyone wants to know the first 6 months road map to being competent, I've taught a half dozen friends how to play in the past decade.  Gratis, of course.

Don't have a guitar and are unsure if it would interest you?  <b>Don't worry, I have about a dozen at any given time</b>, and will loan you a basic one to practice on for a few weeks.

Also, we definitely need to have a CI band for the next million minute party.  I talked with Ryan about this briefly, but we honestly need to have practices starting now for it to be worthwhile.  If it's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
This board is to share and document the resources I’ve put together for the CRISP training program.  I’ll be posting materials for each week’s activity over the next few days.

@Ian, do we make those 8am calls if the leads have been assigned or otherwise worked in Dealersocket? Since we don't have the integration with elead, that wouldn't really matter in this case. 

You got calls on Sunday? I thought we had Sunday off. As for Saturday, they may have bothered you, but isn't Saturday a very big day for dealers? Salespeople take time off on different days, so I don't really see Saturdays as being <i>the</i> day off. 

@Ian, do we send calls on Sunday?
Duke Silver would be the most ideal sax teacher. Ever.
Project: axreport shift
@Cameron

I'll chat you! I'm definitely interested 
Yep, I can start working on this! 
@Kelly and Sedona- Let me know when a good time is to go over the key points for the script.

@Cameron definitely. I'll send you a PM

@Liem welcome to the dark side, we have smooth jazz
@Jayah, can we go ahead and start a project to build the Miracle Ear log in page? Same style as all the other pages
@Taylor I'm going to come by and say what's up! See what kind of sax I should buy and getting that Kenny G song going. This board was a sign. This is happening.
Jackie!  Nice fast move.
I'm also up for a battle! 

@Taylor that's a very well put-together site. I'd be interested in interviewing if you ever needed anyone! Always trying to get my name out there haha

@Sabrina I could also give lessons if you're interested
I would love some guitar lessons!
I want to see a Friday wrap from DJ Hatch
@Ryan

I may be looking to sell. I wanted to give them a fair shot before letting go.<br>

I'm in for that battle of the bands!
If you want to learn how to DJ without using a computer (that's right, using your ears) I can do that too.


Sabrina, 

I can give you lessons and/or buy your set from you lol
@Liem - my friend met Kenny G at a bar one night, went to his concert the falling night, and was called up on stage to perform with Kenny G. That could be you, my friend.
I have a drum set currently collecting dust! <br>
I am very interested in paying someone for lessons<br>
@Liem I CAN PLAY THAT

Also, go to Sam Ash. Super cheap saxes there.

Random thought - would the musicians in the company be up for conducting a CI "Battle of the Bands" of sorts and organize a fun concert where the CI musicians can practice their trade and the rest of us could enjoy?
I also sent the ICDC one pager to the BDC managers. So that should have helped.
All-

We've been experiencing intermittent reporting issues since May 29th, and we've narrowed it down to a single area: call reviews. 

Today, Hacker Farm will be overhauling this code to enable our customers to listen to calls as soon as possible. In the mean time, we've removed access to review calls and are displaying this message: 'This report is currently unavailable. Check back soon!'.

<b>Not impacted:</b>
<li>Call traffic</li>
<li>Shares</li>
<li>Reports / pods</li>
<li>Emailed Reports</li>

An update will be provided this afternoon.
I was actually looking to buy a saxophone and was going to learn by myself, specifically that Kenny G song. For real.
Those stores are correct.
The wizard has been turned off since the middle of last week due to server issues, so even if these accounts were logging in, they are probably lost.

The following won't help with Sam and my efforts to improve onboarding inside the product, but in an effort to keep our first accounts from growing cold, I am going to have the AC group assigned to Discovery reach out to most of these accounts. 

Exceptions: Nelson Mazda (Monica took good care of them and they are chugging along), eCarOne (Sarah S. is reaching out as they are one of her leads and testing Discovery to see some of Car Wars), Benchmark (Monica has already worked with them).
Another payment was (allegedly) sent on Thursday. It'll be an ongoing struggle, but we can stay on top of these guys. There's still a better-than-decent chance that we're being played, but the risk is minimal given the recent payments.

My latest exchange with Cedric is attached.
I'm always looking for local musicians to review/interview for my freelance gig.

Can also give saxophone lessons.
I also teach guitar if anyone is interested.
Cameron,

This is awesome. I play drums as well, and I would be willing to trade drum lessons for higher end guitar lessons. 
HomeAdvisor has made an app for the Apple Watch.
I apologize for tagging everybody; if music doesn't hold much interest to you, feel free to untag yourself.

<p>Anyways, every musician knows that networking is huge. It's not very often where an opportunity like working with 100+ people, some of which are musicians, arises and I think that this should be taken advantage of.</p>

<p>I'm creating this board to semi-organize or at least collect musical ideas. These could include:</p>

<ul>
<li style = "font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;">Lessons</li>
	Ex. I teach drum lessons to a little kid currently, but I have time to teach more people. I'm sure there are people at CI who have wanted to learn an instrument. This would be the board to get that rolling in.
<li style = "font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;">Jam Sessions</li>
<li style = "font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;">Organized groups</li>
	(bands if you will)
<li style = "font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;">Other musical opportunities</li>
	(gigs, concerts, etc.)
</ul>
That project I pasted below is now complete.
Agenda for tomorrow's call:

- Kelly will walk them through one of our mutual client's account

- They will walk us through their platform and their 'wish list' for the Patient Pursuit integration

- Jian will establish what integration can happen and what can't 

- Nathan will discuss partnership (similar to Breakaway's - the only leads that count as theirs is ones that go to a PP landing page from their platform to get set-up)

- Talk about next steps and their next trip to Dallas


I will forward all of you screenshots they sent us. We will not be pushing any of their data to PP, but it's neat to see everything they report on.
Project: summary feedback on the front-end reporting page
FYI - I received LL calls this Saturday and Sunday.<br>

@Ian, what's the time difference between when the lead comes in and when we generate the call?<br>

Are we ready to get this going for the client this week?<br>

1. Jackie, I changed my mind after talking to Justin. I propose we turn OFF the queued calls at 8 am. They are not relevant at that time and no client will likely want that.<br>

2. Are we able to turn it off on weekends if the client desires?
Yes!
Let me know how I can help ya, Matt
Matt and Keaton - interview Jian or any other folks you can get access to and have it transcribed
A "We Want You Back" Campaign was supposed to be a part of the original cancellation process but never got off of the ground. 

I like your suggestion of keeping the account record in the Go Portal and automating a follow-up touch.  Marketing should be jumping on this as well. Keeping the account record would also allow us to access our past event history.

<a href="http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/bproject_manage.cfm?pid=3698">Original Plan</a>

<a href="http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/bproject_manage.cfm?pid=3702">Follow-up board discussing</a>
I think we need more experienced people calling to save accounts. I've stepped in to assist with many of these conversations and frankly found that it takes someone with a bit more experience/confidence.<br>

Ex. Hayley is talented and experienced but I had to step in to help with Lithia. Dan is talented and experienced and he had Sudds step in and help with a Hiley save call.<br>

What happens if an AC calls and cannot save the account? Do we then have a more experienced person call back?<br>

Toni, if we do utilize your team, maybe we could we have a more experienced person tagged as well. Just like we have a team auditing launches, we could have a save team: Justin, Huck, SarahT, Nathan, Toni....these could be the captains and rotate who reaches out (or delegates to someones) based on who has best relationship.<br>

Also, who is going to visit the accounts we are trying to save? Do we need a "save visit" team/process? I know I feel like
 I'm scrambling every time we have to visit for a save because my team is small and spread thin.


Yes!
If someone has an eLead login - could you please share in here (: 

Thanks for the update Nathan. They are a partner with the Service Roundtable (an association that we have just joined), so we will be able to keep closer tabs on them. 18K customers seems hard to believe, wonder if that's akin to us talking about our 20K. (Most of whom are not that active)
We have a lot of talent in this office.  From being able to chef to climbing very high things made of rocks.  Hidden skills and desires are within a lot of us.  We want to tap into that.

There are opportunities that pop-up all the time, that the marketing team simply can’t get to in a timely fashion.  It’s those times that we want to open the chance to work on something amazing to the whole office.  We’re calling them Semi-Pro Opportunities.  

These projects are not to take the place of your regular job and you can’t use any Semi-Pro as an excuse to drop your day-to-day responsibilities.  It’s a way to build your VORP and contribute to CI.  

Here’s how it works:

A Semi-Pro Opportunity will be posted.  <a href=http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/cproject_manage.cfm?pid=221&conf=comment&newcomment=2501>Like this one.</a>  

If you like it, think you can do it and are cool with the due date, assign it to yourself.  

Once your name is on it, it’s all yours.  You can’t remove someone’s name from the project, so to the quick go the spoils.  

But know this, if you say you want it, the expectation is that it you’ll see it through to the end.  There’s no “hey, I don’t have time to finish this”.  

It’s also the expectation that you’ll use the proper programs to make it real, so design project will use InDesign, Illustrator or Photoshop.  Not Word or PowerPoint.  

We’re always here for help, questions and guidance, so tap into us as much as possible.  

Looking forward to seeing how this works and seeing some amazing work.  
Yes
Attached find the ADP integration screenshots. Make sure to take this with you to your ADP dealerships.

Also, make sure to have an Elead log-in ready if they are on Elead and have CM.
We will try for BMW again and push to talk with the other stores today.
Yes
While we're convincing the GMs to let us call their salesmen, Lead Tag can start calling the BDC. Here's the link to corresponding TC. 
It certainly wouldn't hurt to get out in front of it...


JP - Can you get with Kelly and/or Sedona to start working through a script for phone skills training?
Sounds good.  Should Jenny start working on a script for that, so we have it ready?
Yes
We've turned off Missed Op Alerts while we resolve the reporting issues.
Rough draft of the statistics we want to gather.

<li> Matt is going to gather stats today.
<li> We will then ask Jian to pull any data we couldn't get.
<li> Then the data is off to Kaiti for design.
<li> Jane, can you start a campaign?
I second Monica's proposal. 
First project: Car Wars call summary
Mitchell

Per our conversation last week about Comodo AV - 

Thanks for explaining about the system drain Comodo was causing.  It would be helpful to understand just how much of an impact it's having on your machines.

Can you please reinstall Comodo on 5 laptops over at Lead Tag?  Once the systems begin to show signs of bogging down, would you take a screen shot of the system monitor, sorted by memory usage, and post it to this thread?

I would greatly appreciate that info! 
 
@Jayah, Tony and I discussed and I think there are 2 projects here.

1. GM III live CRISP updates.

This will give the 8 stores in GMIII the ability to see how their CRISP score is moving.

We'd also like to tell them how many missed opportunities they have in their lead box, and their average connection time.

Can we get a project going on this one?

2. Updating the carwars.com/monitor link for all of our CW users. 

Tony will spearhead that effort based on what he knows clients want to display.

Ok, cool.  We're getting close to the end for this campaign.  I say we would need to wait at least a full month before calling back through the list.  We could start with the phone skills training mid July or something like that. 
@Sarah -- the chimer will start at 20-25 seconds and continue to play it every 25 seconds until they enter their phone code. This will happen regardless of transfers.
 No, I'm talking Phonedamentals.  Sold to the same this you called this time, but we need to wait an acceptable amount of time to start calling that same list.
<a href = http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/hproject_manage.cfm?pid=3108>Associated project. </a>
Keep them open and continue to reach out to the GM's today.

They may say that you need to train and update the BDC. Make sure that they know it is still important for  their sales agents to be trained because they will still receive some tracked calls and ill want to be trained on what the chimer means, when and if they hear that. We want to eliminate any confusion.

Please let me know who you haven't been able to get a hold of by EOD today.
For the project to be totally completed, we still need to make some changes to firewall configuration, but the actual zoiper accounts should all be currently working. So, anyone tagged on this board should have the necessary credentials to logon and make some test calls using zoiper. <br />

You can download zoiper <a href = http://www.zoiper.com/en>here. </a> There are specific downloads for most major platforms, but let me know if there are any problems. After downloading, create an account and enter the previously specified credentials for your userid, and it should connect. 
Sweet, Matt and I are talking today at 9am
These in person meetings always turn out tougher to schedule than I always expect.  We need to get in touch with all of these people, figure out when they have some open days, and then firm up the dates.  Let's start laying down the ground work with the people Matt laid out in below.  Make sure they know we want to come.
@Hayley -- What's the scenario for these calls?  When does the chimer kick in?  Is it based off a certain call length?

We can start with a small group for testing, and if there are any problems we can address them. For logging into any zoiper, enter your username as "0000@10.100.1.30:5061", with the four zeros replaced by your user id but keeping any leading zeros, and your password is ac_zoiper_0000, with the same format as the username in regards to the zeros.

Get this on the web! @Hatchell
Love the photo!

Are they knowingly wearing the shirts backwards?
What should we do with any TCs we opened where we weren't able to reach the GM before EOD Friday? 
pics! pics! pics!
I spoke with Scott this morning:

Bad news: Building of the call center has been delayed until September due to some higher priority construction jobs at the dealership.

Better news: Scott is moving forward with a number of "remote" locations for the effort.  He'll have 4 agents here some over there, etc.  He wants to move forward with CI on a few of those locations to prove concept to the powers that be.  That will make it easier to get the go ahead for the larger call center project later this summer.

Scott is going to push our contract through this week and then call me Monday (6/15) with a contract and next steps.
That answers my question.  Thanks!
Great job tying in Social Media CW team!

Loving the blogs all around. 
We had a few LT guys reach out to some of the stores on Friday. Each store wanted us to only call the BDC since the salesmen only answer if the phone if a client specifically asks to be transferred to them. 


Disposition metrics will come shortly after agent reporting.  My intention is to have it built in to that part of CB.  Goal is to have that complete Q2.

Keep in mind - we can only provide analytics and reporting on disposition questions that are multiple choice type questions.  If you have to type text into a field (like a "notes" section) we won't be able to report on that.  That might be useful to think of when you're designing script dispositions.

(Now that I think about that, I'm not sure if my answer was clear or not so if you want me to explain just text/ping me.)
Hey Mike - 


I want to add this to my Call Box wish list... The ability to see disposition summaries in Call Box.  Are there plans to put summaries of dispositions in Call Box?  Right now, every time I want to see how a campaign is going and what the dispositions are, I have submit a case with you and Ian tagged and then Ian queries the database to get the information.  



Corporate has been notified of the stores being visited. This should help make planning a little easier.

However, if any of you are experiencing any difficulty scheduling an on-site. Please let me know.

Remember--keep your script as vague as possible. I'm more than happy to go over it again or role play as well.
Who are the accounts that we have successfully saved? What do these save attempts have in common?

This is important. If we're most successful when Nathan or I make the save call, then that is what we should do.
made a case yesterday that no one has looked at, Jashona is too busy, so please someone fix this.  I just put Ian as manager because he fixed the same problem last week in 10 min once he got to it after two days.  Really Two days again???????

Do you know how much they are paying in overages currently?  It would be a ton, right?

Wouldn't it just make sense to pitch a CW + SS package that is probably very close in price?


The purpose of this board is to outline an upcoming trip to Arizona. Tentative dates early July. The reason for going is both to train JPI's two assets on RB and prospecting meetings. 

Catherine from Lincoln is our primary contact for these two JPI assets and she's got a bunch of new properties coming online in the greater Denver area. Onsite training will give us a great opportunity to outline a plan of attack for her Denver properties.

Will set a meeting with Topher Olsen of Alliance to go through the first month + of RB data and outline a plan to expand.

PB Bell - Based in Scottsdale is evaluating RB for 10-25 properties. This could serve to close them on RB or training. Will know more as it gets closer.

We've got a huge list of prospects from the state of Arizona and can spend the next month setting meetings. 

@Keaton - Is there anything that I missed?
Here is the poll to decide the buy in. There should be 17 votes total, you can only vote once. 
The draft will be done through the Fantrax online draft program on their website. I'd like to set the draft date for the last Sunday in July in the evening. We can vote on that as well as we get closer. 

Let's keep all communication in this board about league setup, questions, etc. 
Alright ladies and gents, lets get this thing started.

I sent out invitations to the league through Fantrax, the website we'll use to keep track of everything. 

I'm thinking the buy in should be either $20 or $25 with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place getting prizes. I'll post a poll shortly so we can decide what the buy in should be.

I recommend everyone download the Fantrax app and register as a member (it's free). While it's not the prettiest thing in the world, it gets the job done and it's the best tracker for College Fantasy.


For Asbury, the formal approval goes through both Ion and John Ellithorp. John signs the contract.

$1481 it is.
clearly this is becoming an issue for a case so I am going to open one and tag you all and whomever else may need to get us up and running.  This seems just like what happened last weekend that lasted through Tuesday.  That is unacceptable as far as down time for our clients who also cannot access any of their info.  
still not working

The documentation from CI side should be proof of the failed congestion calls and associated tickets. 
If we have been having 7% congestion call failure for the past month we've got a bigger issue than I anticipated based on our last meeting with level III where they moved us to enterprise-level I will have to have further discussions with level III but before that I need to see the tickets that have been opened during the last month and whatever documentation we can compile. 
Sounds great. I've already started a script (linked in previous comment below) for those accounts wanting to cancel. We know they're a problem and we know we're not doing a good job of addressing them.  

What's next? Everyone is pointing out where we are failing and that we have a problem, but  not proposing a solution (next attempt at). 

I'd like to train a few of my team to take these on. AEs do not live out of the Go Portal as ACs do. AEs are not measured by TC activity as ACs are. There is no incentive for an AE to promptly respond to and save an account. AEs are driven (as we've instructed them) by new revenue, not old. I originally thought AEs would be the best to respond to cancellations because they should be the most equipped to re-sell an account.  We've seen little success and slow response time. I'd like to try something new.

May I move forward with my proposed plan below to train a team of ACs to take this challenge on?

We <a href="http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/bproject_manage.cfm?pid=4094">discussed</a> these guys briefly at the beginning of the year. While this article only speaks to ad spend and keyword tracking, it looks like they're into home services these days with National Builder Supply from the wholesale supply side. NBS is Atlanta based(like CallRail).
Cancellations suck. We're working to fix how we respond to those requests <A HREF="http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/bproject_manage.cfm?pid=4689"> here.</A>

That said, they do happen. We often see these clients come back though. Steve made a great point yesterday...why not be proactive about it?

Best I can tell, when clients cancel, they're removed from the Go Portal as an account and essentially no longer exist. To maximize on this, what if we instead marked those accounts with a canceled status and automatically scheduled a touch for 3-6 months later?
Agree on all counts. That MB is a fail. They told us that they were thinking about canceling and we just closed out the TC and moved on.

Let's define what should have happened there (i.e. - an account indicates that they are "at risk.")

Separately, let's define what should happen when someone reaches out and says "I want to cancel at the end of the month." Let's actually script it out, then decide who should be executing on that playbook.

New clients are really hard to win. We need to fight hard to keep them once we have them.
Lol I can't figure out wth to go
We've also learned that Siri can't be trusted... Jane wouldn't trust her with saving the world.
We go with pre-7:00 on a Saturday brain.... 
bamboozling around trying to find each other you say? 

Shall we blame that on autocorrect or Siri or...?
My assistant was having difficulty identifying exactly where the paddle boats were. White rock is a large lake. Toni made the executive desicion that meeting together in one place (a park) was better than having 20 people bamboozling around trying to find each other.

To answer your question.... Yes, we liked the icon.
I'm pretty sure kayaking is at the question mark location but I could be wrong.... Does anyone really know if where Toni wants is the right spot or Toni just liked the icon?
I'll take a rough stab at this first thing next week.
Netflix in the background. Nice!
Good stuff!!
Grudge Match Champion Jose Lazo from South Dade sent this over to me today 

They got their GM Champion T-shirts. 

"Give everyone at CI a big thanks from us.... When are you coming back to South Dade for more Cuban coffee?" 

Yes, it's true. I did like the Cuban coffee. It's got an extra kick to it. 
When Nathan threw the shade...
My Friday inspiration:

The fact that at CI when you ask a group of new hires to say something interesting about themselves, you <i><b>NEVER</i></b> know what you're going to get.

Would someone post a progress update before EOD?  Thanks!!
quick update here:

The project to configure outbound trunks has been completed.

Konrad has been made aware of this.

Our relationship with sip exchange to act as an alternative outbound carrier is awaiting some points on our end.   These were put back because of server issues this week but I was never involved in the original discussions there.  i've asked konrad for the information necessary to get sip exchange what they need to get that all set up.

I'm also in discussions with onvoy networks as a third alternative.

per an offline discussion with BP we do keep a report of congestion but sillilly we only group this by channel type in the daily telephony report.   I'm creating a case to get smarter about this reporting.

We should be able to proactively and possibly automatically reroute outbound traffic based on the best carrier (much like leve3 claims to do).
i will actually start loading CD accounts starting from the bottom CD-Roseville towards CD-Modesto
Great summary Brandon.

re: QA- We'd need to know more about their call process and QA process but it sounds like an opportunity worth exploring

Hotels outsources 85%+ of their call center operations.  The whole telephone process is an extremely complex operation between various departments at Hotels (sales, support, call center management, cloud services) and the sourced call centers.  I suspect you could spend a year figuring out how everything works together and still be very confused.

Future note for me: <br>
- Make a deliberate effort to identify the top 3-5 metrics used by small/medium call centers and make sure we are building that into reporting.  
not yet
@RW, are you comfortable with us touting the 27 minutes with prospects?
Just something to keep in mind- when loading your five calls, please do not load five from one account. The accounts on the list pay to have only two calls per month to be coached. These accounts sometimes already have one of these calls already coached. Please only load 1 (one) call per account. Thanks!
I put not annoying cause Sam is entertaining. There was no such option. 'Dis okcupid...
@Sam - you probably got more hate due to the (insert codyesque deep psychological concept here) principle that says that it's more fun to say sam's annoying than it is to say that sam <b>isn't</b> annoying.   Personally, I don't think your annoying, but I said you were in the survey because doing so seemed more amusing.
I will bring breadddddd <3

It seems that I have received a lot more hate on this survey since I made that comment about Myranda's hamburger...

Lovely, who is actually going to help us get the material for sandwiches?
Today Dan Hutchins, Mike King, and I met with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=11959148&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=zbPZ&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1433533556036%2Ctas%3Akevin%20bains">Kevin Bains</a> from Hotels.com . Kevin is a personal friend of mine and is the hotels.com director of customer care. He manages 6 call centers both onshore and offshore.

A couple high points-

- We learned a lot about call center management- Forecasting, KPI's, Metrics, etc. The most important factor for Kevin is protecting margins, and the main KPI they look at for protecting their margins is First Call Resolution.

- The average life cycle for their technology use/ turnover appears to be around 10 years. So if you miss the window to get your product in with them it's going to be awhile before you get another chance.

Perhaps the biggest takeaway was in regards to their "High Value Calls". Their IVR system asks customers at booking a few questions(Is your trip international or domestic?, Is your trip longer than 3 days?, etc.) If a certain amount of these questions is answered "YES" then the call is identified as a "high value call" and is routed more quickly to a more experienced sales agent at their sales call center in springfield, Missouri. Right now their QA is handled by offshore call reviewers who review a small percentage of their total calls each month.

There is a real play with these high value calls for humanatic. What if we could review 100% of their high value calls and tee up missed opportunities for them so they could save some trips that may have been lost? And do all of it for equal or less than what they are paying their current offshore call center? That's a big opportunity.

@Mike and @Dan- Please chime in with your take aways from the meeting, and thoughts going forward.
Now my neck hurts.  Thanks, Jay.
Deja vu all over again.
platform_a/mx_users_new_axreport.cfm is updated. 
FYI, I have added a new column to the axreport table:

auto_generated NOT NULL DEFAULT(0)

This column should be set to 1 whenever we create an axreport that is automatically generated by our system. Example: daily claimed calls, Daily Lead Box calls, etc.

From now on, if you build out a new automatic axreport, set this bit to 1 during the insert into axreport so we know it was us that generated it. Its mostly so we can easily exclude these from the automated reports page. We don't want our users modifying these reports. 

Also, if you have created an automatic axreport in the past, and its not within one of these files, please let me know. I've tried to go back and set all the ones we've already done to have auto_generated = 1, but I'd like to know for sure that I got all of them.

I will bring appetizer things, including a veggie tray. 
I volunteer to bring:

Anything else I want
TEAM!  For those who are kayaking (or want to join)

We are meeting at White Rock Lake Park at 11:00am tomorrow to picnic/hang out before kayaking. 

 <i>If you are kayaking, you MUST be present by 12:45</i>

Since we are not sure of the availability of grills, we will go the traditional picnicking route.  

I will bring 2 pounds of sliced Cajun turkey (it's the good sh*t, not the crappy pre-packaged lunch meat).

We need volunteers to bring:
<li>Sliced bread
<li>Cheese
<li>Lettuce
<li>Condiments
<li>Chips
<li>Veggies
<li>Watermelon (?)
<li>Paper towels
<li>Plates
<li>Anything else you want

BYOB (stay away from glass containers)
<br>

I will bring ladderball and a volleyball for entertainment.  If you have fun, outdoor games, bring them along!!
<br>

Finally, don't forget to bring $$ if you owe MiKing!!  He get's grumpy when he does not get paid.
Here's a map of where to meet tomorrow.
I didn't know other people's comments were able to penetrate Sam's rough chitinous exoskeleton.

Very cool, can't wait to see what this is used for in your wrap.
The Struggle is real down in District 12
Yes. We'd have to recognize that the log in came from go.centuryinteractive.com and set a session variable that flags the session as a CI employee. Or something similar to exclude gathering analytics data.
Sam, I used that to wipe the mayo off the sandwich :) 
I probably would have just used the paper that your sandwich was wrapped with to begin with...
Glad I made a bulletin board first.

So if we did anything, we would have to not just look at user, but somehow recognize that the referring source is the go portal?
Reporting in from District 12. Coffee filters are plates here. 
That is going to be very hard. When you log in through the go portal, you log in as an actual user that is set up on that particular account. The system doesn't see you as a CI employee, it sees you as whatever user the Go Portal used to log you in.  
When Sam presented Product Analytics last week, there were a lot of questions about what the analytics would show if we (CI employees) went into client's accounts and performed actions.

1. It is correct that we will show that the user we have logged in as performs these actions, correct?

I don't think we need to block all CI employee actions from showing. For example, if someone sets up ax_reports for a client, I think it's fine to show that the account set up ax_reports. Our people need to know that we'll report on that.

However...

2. Can we exclude logins through the Go Portal from showing as "logins" or counted as "active users"?

One area where this is particularly messing me up is tracking the new Discovery accounts. It's important to see that these users have at least logged in, but I'm having a hard time telling, because I am positive we have logged in through the Go Portal to get into those new accounts. 
Next board, pictures of the Pitz home office/fishing shack, please!
I had to take the lob.  
Ouch Jayay... I thought you were better than this.  Matt, I expected it from you.
The email says you just registered yourself, and the website appears to be partially broken. The link in the email just takes us to the conference homepage where it lists the session videos and the brief description of astricon.
Yes, that should be it - here's the message from the most recent call that was executed:
<br />
Car Wars Lead Launch for AMSI - Scott Clark Toyota Scion. Enter your phone code to claim this call. MICHAEL GISSING filled out a lead through DealerOn about a 2013 Ford Escape. Enter your phonecode to call them at  7 0 4 6 4 9 0 3 5 3 
<h2>District 5 Reporting in</h2>
Guys, I'm sure Keaton's breakfast meeting just ran long.  
@Konrad - I didn't tag the rest of the support team because it wouldn't be right to really start using this until comwave is ready to start taking traffic
We had a fantastic lunsh at El Corozon with Conseula our patron saint of awesome Tex Mex.

I had Jayah listen to one and he couldn't understand it either. Ohhhh so maybe it's trying to say AMSI?

Cause I hear it say Scott Clark Toyota. 

"The Pitz" needs that American flag on deck at all times.
Too much congestion on a particular line?   Need to do some special routing for a particular number (state farm point to point, sip gateway, et cetera).

Now that's all configurable from within the go portal.

A new ops link: "Operations:: change alt carrier"

which links to <a href='http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/admin.cfm?go_lid=212'>http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/admin.cfm?go_lid=212</a> which will allow you to change the outbound carrier for calls to the particular dnis.

carrier1_pipe means level3
<h3>WIN A $20 GIFT CARD!!</h3>

I made a quiz for my wrap next week and I would really appreciate it if everyone took a few seconds to fill it out.  One lucky participant will be randomly chosen and will receive a $20 gift card to target. 


Filling out the quiz will not make you subject to any individual attention during the wrap.  It is for an analysis of our office as a whole. 
HAA! The boat is officially named "The Pitz"
@Jayah, what's the name of the dude from our LUNSH group who ducked out today?
<h1>South Dallas Represent.</h1>




There were a few of you who wanted to see this.  I want to brag a bit on behalf of Ryan.  Here is a before and after photo of Ryan's new boat.  Let's get another photo of the RB team holding Matt in the air while going 90mph on this boat.
Thank you Taylor! 
Added Vicky to the board (FYI you have to goto manage on the bottom and add her) :)

Hey guys, <br>

This was the project I was telling y'all about earlier this morning. I need you to go through this list and<br>
1. check if they are a current client and note in the first column<br>
2. make sure the contact for each dealership is correct (some might be wrong, so if this is the case be sure to update with the current GM or GSM)<br>
3. add the contact's email address (can be found on their website or by calling the dealership if not on the website)<br>
4. add the contact's linkedin link (can be found by googling XYZ name, XYZ dealership linkedin)<br><br>

Hey Guys,

I just registered us for astricon 2015.

This year it's going to be held on October 13-15, 2015 in Orlando, FL
How to fill the room:

* in-person meetings with all local contacts and networking groups

* Jessica Baxter invitation to her network

* triple our invitation list

* we need to tightly control the email correspondence leading up to the event

* 2 waves of direct mail

* increase reminder emails and include text reminders and phone call reminders
Same venue

Same agenda and schedule

Let's fill the room
Target date = July 23
Hmm... the code in place should prevent calls after 8 PM. I read through the page, and I don't know why it would have executed that call. 

1) it's saying the store name: AMSI Scott Clark Toyota

2) it can happen sometimes, yes
I don't want to muddle Jackie's board with too many comments but remember getting a client on-board with the chimer is more than ideal, it's somewhat necessary. 

Without the chimer, clients won't be able to distinguish a tracked call from an untracked call. Consequently, callers will hear the phone code digits being entered on untracked calls. 
Awesome, thanks Jackie! Also, here is the one pager. I have had several people ask where they can find it in Pipeline since the face-lift. 
I'll tee up for next week so we can push for that completion date. 
Update from this list:

<i>1. Turn off Handled By for new accounts (and active launches).

2. We can start training on ICDC for those accounts, but they will be brand new.

3. Turn on ICDC for existing CW sales lines.

4. Start roll out to turn off Handled By on existing accounts (and turn on Lead Box alerts, etc.)
</i>

#3 is now complete. We have have an active project to get the chimer option added to MANDNIS so that user can control chimer on/off for every line (front end is complete). 



Few more notes:<br>

1. The beginning of the recording says "Car Wars Lead Launch call for ______" It sounds like it says "answer" or something like that. I cannot understand it. Does anyone know what she says?<br>

2. I received Voicemails from the calls I did not answer this morning. Is that supposed to happen<br>




One thing you guys need to consider when adding or removing categories is that each category fits into CRISP.

We need to make sure that we keep questions that help agents be better at requesting the appointment (like two dates and times) and booking firm appointments.

What we should not do: Just list a bunch of things that most agents say on every call because it's their job. Remember that these are phone skills, not just qualification questions that they need to do their computer searches.

I think some are both of those things, and maybe not enough agents ask the qualification questions they should, but please be mindful of that.
Also, I received a call last night at 7:56pm CST (8:56 EST). Do we send calls until 9 pm client time zone? I can't remember if it's 8pm or 9pm<br>

AND received a bunch of calls this morning starting at 7:01 am (which makes sense because they are EST) and coming every 2-3 minutes. Prob 14 total. I thought we decided not to tee up calls from night before because they aren't timely anymore but talked to Jackie offline. We are going to leave this on for now.


As of today, all CW lines have ICDC turned on with the chimer off. This basically means that anyone can use in call digit collection, but they don't know it, because they won't hear the chimer.

We've trained on this, but ICDC phone code format is #1234#

You can check out this documentation for more info on ICDC.

Due to some magic from dialtag, ICDC can now be used on any line (even if there is an internal bridge). If you want more information, this is because they started using asterisk feature codes for ICDC. 

Chimers can be turned on for any line. For now, make a case to turn on chimer for certain lines. ALSO, as of dialtag's rollout this morning, the chimer is now quieter.  We have an active project for getting the chimer configuration on MANDNIS (where we provision tracking lines inside the product). 

We are also in the midst of moving towards a more consistent phone code format so that we have an easier time training and agents don't have to know when to use different phone code formats. 
I posted the login in this board early on. Here it is:

For documentation purposes:

Chris Frey gave me a login for SC Toyota:

Username:152438753

Password: century1

@Ian, can you please check on timing for us.


Myranda, no one is stopping you from participating.  There is a South office sign up too.  YOu are welcome to join Mitchell and me today as is anyone from Lead Tag or North Dallas.  
We are watching for the hotel hcats to populate.  Currently only 1 call available on each.  We will jump in as soon as there are more.  

Yeah, new developers, vote on the day for the river tubing event!
I just added the new dev to this board, so is this still happening?
Consulting Project created and TCs assigned to team
We could remove:

Did the agent ask at least one question about the caller's leasing preferences?
Did the agent describe the features and benefits of the property?

And put instead:
Did the agent ask how many people would be living in the unit?
Did the agent ask the resident's preferred move-in date?
Did the agent describe the features and benefits of the property?
Did the agent describe the features and benefits of the apartment home?

I think this would be a good change. It's easier (read: more spelled out) for the human reviewers and would give management more insight
I really wish we could participate in this. Sounds and looks like a lot of fun. Unfortunately there are too many miles between us and we only have 30 minutes for lunch. 
This is great. I've been corrected on the resident one, but unaware of the others. 
Would you like to mirror the CW wording? It's something more like, "did the agent ask at least one question about..."

Jackie, do you know if that wording is deliberate for easier/more accurate human reviewing? 


Hey guys! Happy Friday!

Just a reminder to be ready to go through these intros rapid-fire style. 

Also, after you hear your first Friday Wrap presentations and see what they're all about, email me at jackie@centuryinteractive.com to sign up for auditions on the 17th! I promise auditions aren't scary. They're to show Mike and me that you have an idea, came prepared, and to get some feedback and pointers.
Hmmm.... no push back from me. Do it.
You want:

<li>Did the agent ask how many people would be living in the unit?
<li>Did the agent ask the resident's preferred move-in date?
<li>Did the agent describe the features and benefits of the property?
<li>Did the agent describe the features and benefits of the apartment home?

We currently have:

<li>Did the agent ask at least one question about the caller's leasing preferences?
<li>Did the agent describe the features and benefits of the property?
The only thing I would consider adding to "reason appt not booked" is - Appt already set, tour already completed...  something like that.

Thanks Jackie for pushing that project forward.
#2 is so important though! What's your objection to it, Keaton?

1,3,4 all seem viable.  

We should also consider deleting some of our current hcats.  I don't like that we have 3 different follow up questions.

And then you fight to the death
Good stuff!  Keep it coming.
Awesome, thanks!
Still doing some spot checking but updates have been made. 



True about those additional hcos being more relevant for why an appt wasn't requested. Keaton, I'll keep that in mind. 
The UUIDs that we are using here (generated by Coldfusion's CreateUUID() method) are guaranteed to be unique, they are also rather secure since trying to guess a 35 character string of random letters and numbers is not easy.

If we generated our own IDs, we could choose how long the sting is. There are some issues with that approach, though: <ul>
<li>The shorter the string is, the less number of 'unique' IDs we will be able to generate</li>
<li>We couldn't guarantee each ID is actually unique; each time we generate a new ID, we would have to check every record in the DB to ensure we're not inserting duplicate IDs. This would generate a lot of overhead</li>
<li>We could guarantee unique IDs by auto-incrementing the ID each time, but that would be easily hijacked. This is not even an option.</li>

Its not impossible to get a shorter ID, but it would be more difficult and could cause more issues than just using a proven method of unique ID generation. 

Oops, meant to say that that project will add those HCOs to Lead Box config, search for a call, and ax_reports (automated reports). 
@Sarah T, we can use the login they gave us.  Do you still have that?
Project
Most of those extra category scenarios wouldn't result in a call going through this HCAT because the agent would never invite the caller in in the first place.

In answer to the original question, yes, we can get those appt bot booked HCOs added as options in searches and ax reports. 
This looks like competition!!!!

I was on the phone with one of the clients we're onboarding yesterday and she was eager to share the "7 Dirty Words of Multi-Family". Leaders in the space know that you're not familiar with the industry if you say any of these following terms:

<s>Tenants</s>.... should be Residents. Always Residents

<s>Unit</s>....Apartment Home

<s>Complex</s>...word on the street is they hate complex. Instead, Community

<s>Prospect</s>....Future Resident/ Guest

<s>Handicap</s>....Disability

Affordable Housing is now coined Workforce Housing

And funny store, the client completely blanked on the 7th. Will include if I find it in the future. 

Hopefully this is good information to note for pitches and value props when we're speaking to clients. 
Sent you two an invite for 3:30.
@Sarah, let us know if you can figure out the timing between when a lead hits eLead and when your phone rings. 

@Ian, can we see timing on our side?
Hooray LUNSH!
Also, the cancellation list is obviously not complete as it is missing some accts (link below). If we want to track cancellations, and I think we do, we should be diligent in creating events for them.

I'm guilty as charged for this!
THIS WOULD BE AWESOME 
Remember to coordinate with your LUNSH groups today :D
For reference: 
I'm in middle of saving MB of New Orleans now and it should've been an "at-risk" engagement first. I am not picking on Shanon, but I have attached the last TC from this acct that's a perfect example of a client that we knew was not happy and now 3 months later has cancelled.


We'll get LT in there today.

These are all the categories I feel are relevant. That doesn't mean they need to necessarily be hcos but let's hash that out. The ones with a ** are already hcos

<br>** Price Objection / Price quoted was not in caller’s budget. 
<br>** Move in time not available. 
<br>** Still thinking about a decision 
<br>** Other reason not booked. 
<br>** Desired unit not available. 
<br>** Pets are not allowed at this property 
<br>Follow-up Location objection 
<br>Future Resident not qualified (pets, credit history, criminal record, income, rental history) 
<br>Future Resident Calling for future occupancy 
<br>Future Resident referred to an online leasing link 
<br>Future Resident’s lease is pending approval
Hcats are on the account now and ready for Super Humans and Lead Tag to review. 
ok

Sounds awesome!  
Hold off reaching out Deshia. I'm going to have a conversation with Lisa on Monday first before acquiring another list. 

Do I need to reach out for a new list and get it uploaded?
Sure thing, I'll have that ready to go by the end of the day.
That's aggressive, but effective!

We've looked at the evaluation sheets of a couple competitors, and we (the Rent Buzz team) think there are a few that we should definitely consider adding to our evaluation as well. The goal here is to decide if any of the following are important enough to be added for our review, as well as to add more that we might have missed on this first attempt.

1) "Did the agent ask why the customer is moving"

2) Breaking up "Did the agent describe features and benefits of the property?" into two parts: one about apartment features and a separate one for property amenities.

3) "Did the agent ask how many people would be living in the unit?"

4) "Did the agent ask the resident's preferred move-in date?"
Mitchell - Can you set up all Lead Consultants on Team Myranda with the ability to transfer calls to 21st Century Dental.  I'll add that to your project cue.  



Myranda/Deshia/Jenny:  No immediate action required.  But, if 21st Century Dental agrees to the paid terms Monday, we'll acquire a new list and start placing calls really soon with the new transfer feature. 

Got it
We're going to add the transfer feature to our process to create even more value and potentially line them up as a paying client.  Here's the new process...


1.  We call dormant patient

2.  Dormant patient expresses interest in an appointment

3.  We transfer the caller to the 21st century dental office

4.  21st century dental sets the appointment

5.  We get paid per appointment booked ($25/appointment)

I want to start charging 21st Century Dental for us placing outbound calls to dormant patients.  They were our first real client so we've given them quite a big discount (free!).  I've got a meeting lined up with Lisa Monday to discuss.  
Don't let your dreams be dreams!

1. They need to be differentiated in the action feed from just a traditional TC -- Save is an urgency thing (sometimes I get tagged in TCs just to follow them or on accident... differentiating them in my action feed would be a tremendous help)

2. We need to identify "at risk" vs. "save" accounts.  Right now our save process generally starts when someone submits a cancellation request.  However what we really need to dial in is those that are at-risk. We have a better chance of actually saving an at-risk account.  An example would be -- we're looking at a competitor, Call Source says they can do everything you do and more, we aren't finding value in the alerts, our GMs say the tool doesn't work.  

Examples of at-risk accounts that we are taking action on now are Lithia, Glendale Subaru and Mitsubishi.  Hiley is a good example of one that was at-risk and we were unable to move the needle prior to the save accounts.


This needs to be completely over hauled. Version 1, while light years beterm than zero, has been a failure  (that's what we do, right?).

Don't feel encumbered by this failure. How should we handle these?

Thank you again for your generous sponsorship - everyone is very excited about the event and are thankful to you for your support!
Interesting.  I bet she was counting down to pitch day so she could sell an investor.  Interesting lady.
Monica, 6:04pm question: Yes.   If you think we should add hcos, then wait until that is completed.
Based on what you have listened to from our RB accounts, the list I just posed, and the other CI products, do you think we need to add hcos to Reason not Booked?  
PopCard - Reasons not booked options
Does anyone want to raise their hand and make the first attempt at researching the metrics and typing up some sentences about what they found?
I think the Ariva Review is closer to the metrics and statements we want to make.  
OK.

So by this point everyone is debt free, we have budgets in place, we have stashed away a great emergency fund, and our homes are purchased.  Who knew we would get this far in just a few months?

Next up we will talk about investing.

Topics:<br>
1. What is stock? What is a mutual fund? <br>
2. What is a 401(k)?  What is an IRA? <br>
3. Who is Roth and why is she so untraditional and why do I care? <br>
4. There are literally like a dozen mutual funds in the world - possibly more.  How do I begin to pick the ones that are right for me? 

Time: Noon <br>
Date: Thursday 6/11/15 <br>
Place: Castle
Ariva Review
I like the infographic and design, but I think we can do a little more on the metrics.  This would be a cool piece to follow.
Here are the common themes I saw: <br>
26 % Agent did not offer an appointment/ no appointment discussed (26 out of the 100 calls)<br>
10% Client promised to call back (10 out of 100 calls)<br>
12% Agent was unable to answer the callers questions (12 out of 100 calls)<br>

12% Marked incorrectly (12 calls, 4 of which should have been marked Calendar instead of other)

that leaves 40% of misc. reasons that would genuinely fall into an "other" category.
Monday afternoon is pretty open for me, what time works for you?
State Farm has passed us along several questions that they are sending to all of their vendors. They are working to mitigate their risk exposure to POODLE vulnerability.  I am going to be in office next week and this is due by next Wednesday (6/10), but I wanted to make sure to get the ball rolling now.

@BP: do you mind indicating any responses to the questions below that you know and who I should reach out to for any of the remaining ones? Thanks!

Here are the questions (The message below is a direct copy of the email- I believe some are not applicable to us and have indicated so in parentheses):

For each vendor, what protocol is used to pass data back and forth between State Farm and the Vendor.

The protocol choices are listed below – please respond Yes or NO for each one. 

- VPN

- MPLS

- WEB

- SSH

- FTP

- SFTP

- SSL

- TLS

- HTTP

- HSTS

- VTAM

- PGP

Include information regarding the Vendor service/product represented by the engagement. (MC: this is referring to any we said yes to above)

Provide the name of the Vendor Systems Solutions person contacted regarding this request. (MC: I can list myself here, unless we feel that it would be better to list someone with a technical background)

Indicate the Vendor’s access to State Farm data is mail (paper file) or disc storage, or email only; or, there is no electronic connectivity for this vendor. (MC: I think we would need to call out our relationship with the EL, correct?)

Indicate if the vendor engagement is no longer active. (MC: We are active--- this is not applicable to us)
So I have gone through all of the reporting that I have access to and am not able to manually put together a comprehensive list of the individuals from SF that access our reporting tools. I believe a good portion of my issue is the automatic login that we utilize for them.

@All: is there any way for us to distinguish unique SF users if multiple are using the automatic login? (I believe the answer is no, but want to check first)
Let's add this to a new board
Why can't we do a shorter ID number?
Thanks. 

Case to review:

Hopefully we should be able to update the code to only look for unique leusers some duplicate entries don't occur. 

I'm not sure why it was inserted so many times in the database.
Reference account below.
Here are all the Reasons Not Booked. Would you like to add all them, Keaton?

(56629) Price quoted was not in caller’s budget. 
<br>(56630) Move in time not available. 
<br>(56631) Still thinking about a decision 
<br>(56632) Other reason not booked. 
<br>(93338) Desired unit not available. 
<br>(93344) Pets are not allowed at this property
Did you not get my pun or are you trolling with the full force of all 10,000 hours behind you?
Here's what we got for Rent Buzz
For example, here are the options available within Patient Pursuit
It appears the Rent Buzz options for Automated Email Alerts is very slim compared with the options available for Patient Pursuit and Service Hook. 

Rent Buzz includes none of the Reasons Not Booked hcos 

I'd like to get with Product to get these added as automated e-mail preferences. 
@Reid, I have some thoughts on a few things we can try to speed up the review process a little bit (following the same basic approach I used to speed up lead launch executions). If we can utilize cfthreads in a similar way here, I don't think it would be that hard to bypass execute_queue.cfm as a requirement for moving the call to the next category (if we're going for under 27 minutes, waiting for a 10 minute process isn't feasible) without significantly slowing down categorize_hcab.cfm


As far as I can see, that's as short as we can get the URL on our end. We need that unique ID string to match up the callid and user who received the alert so we can log the action. And the a=sms tells touch what to do with the request (look up an alert that was sent via SMS). 
Can you tag an account for reference please. 
The GA report Jayah is referring to is called Reverse Goal Path. The report does show up to 3 previous landing pages a visitor was on before calling, but we saw that the information visible in the report is only a trickle of the total number of actual phone call conversions so this won't work as a solution.

Besides click trail (from looking at individual calls), I couldn't find any reports in Call Measurement that would give us the web pages a visitor hit before calling.
Jayah,

We had a productive call today.   There are really two key things to create:

1 The form fill discussed in this thread.

2 The quick Excel download of all relevant numbers discussed in another thread.

Can we spin off a project for #1 and I will start to guide us toward an outcome they can see (with your help, of course).

No, we need to shorten it on our own.
Spoke with CARFAX today about this simple spreadsheet option.  It was a hit.  

Jayah, can you create a project to get this going?
I was a bit dismayed with our first meeting.  She seemed uninterested in my explanation of how to package themselves to aim for investment so they can take the actions they want with capital to fuel them.  I explained that investors are more interested in a business that has "turned the wheel" and sold/onboarded someone at least once, and who has a solid business model.  The product itself should be minimum viable product and then move on to selling it and making a business.

She kind of bulldozed through my discussion and ignored my advice towards getting their business model and action steps down on paper.

They would do well to get advice from you on how to get to that first onboard/sell hurdle.
I've asked for 10 minutes on John Dehass' calendar to pick his brain on a couple things.

I'd like to get an understanding for what happens today when an internet lead comes in and matches a customer record that has a status of inactive.

If there are anything else you want me to have him walk me through... let me know.

Would eLead be able to utilize our sourcing information given the outlined plan below?  @Justin -- would this solve the sourcing complication that exists today?
We'll start tying together the pieces soon. I'll make sure everyone has clarity as we get closer. There are still a lot of unknowns.
@Keaton- I knew about the crack selling story, she did an interview a while back that we saw.

They are definitely an interesting company and team.  I agree that they don't know how to sell the product though.  Every time I talk with them I ask them who they're looking to sell to, and they've seemed to be at the same stage of "target market identified, but no headway made on specific buyers".


To Avi's #2 - we should separate in to two different questions, one about apartment features and a separate one for property amenities. 

I've also seen *Did the agent ask how many people would be living in the unit?

*Did the agent ask the resident's preferred move-in date
YES!! @RW -- Today I'm jumping up and down!! 

Kayaking in circles around you. You won't even know what to do.
*Raw athleticism 
Lay it on me, Jackie! 

I need someone to reach out to Bryan Easler Toyota. If you're up for it, I'll give you the low down. 
Toni you're going to be kayaking in circles while the rest of us will have a glorious competition of athleticism 
Monica, you'll need to verify with my assistant, he's handling all the arrangements. But I believe that would be perfectly acceptable.
I've also seen multiple accounts where the user has been added 20+ times.
@Monica

I'm the party planning chairperson for this event.
Toni, I won't be able to stay and kayak but I'd love to meet up at 11 like you proposed to BBQ and hangout. 

Is that offer still on the table?

Just speaking personally I hate voicemails and never listen to them. Having a tool like this is a great option in my opinion. 

From a prospect perspective, I haven't received a ton of questions around voicemails. Also, this could be a beneficial tool for resident/ maintenance calls. 

The purpose of this board is to spin a project for marketing to put together a case study template and get ready for plugging in management company's data.

First - Lincoln

Second - Greystar
This could easily be an a la carte feature. 

Like $100 for monthly vm call summaries. 

Would LOVE to hear the team's thoughts 
Patient Pursuit and Rent Buzz are in a situation to accommodate this 100%. We have active projects in place that will allow PP and RB clients to set-up specifically "Client Left Voicemail" auto alerts. 
This statistic is used constantly on the RB team: " Less than 1 out every 5 voice messages left by a prospective resident receives a call back from a leasing consultant within 48hrs."

It's true. And I make sure to suggest our clients setting themselves up with instant Missed Op alerts for unconnected calls specifically to combat this. 

However, while I was driving home several weeks ago, I heard an ad on the radio for a vendor whose whole pitch was providing e-mail transcriptions of voicemails. And I thought, well we have all the capabilities to do the same thing. 

This board is to discuss the opportunity of Voicemail specific call summaries. 

Awesome. Lauren and I will have about 250 obsessed reviewers in Mumbai ready to rock next week.
Rebecca is loading in D's this afternon for a few minutes, Marielda is loading from the first DP down 5 calls and Kenzie is loading C's
Yeah I can do it.
I made this project to keep it front of mind. Originally I said Jian, but you're right, we should probably assign to Phil.
Shares resent.  There were only 4 calls.
I am pitching a store in person next week, i'm am up against CR. So this is a huge VP.

Phil is the expert. @Phil, can you help write the document?
Whoops.  I didn't configure that part.  I only checked the box in the Manage numbers section.

Can you resend the shares?  That way, they'll have the calls I placed.
@Mike,

Account #441 is the Dealersocket Dev account in our system. I've configured the outbound line to share to Dealersocket.  

Test away.
"via the DNI number to the pages they viewed on the website before placing the call "


I remember in a past lifetime that you could see the page before in analytics, that functionality I imagine is still there, and yes form fills being tracked in GA is pretty standard if they want to utilize that. 

It's the same way we do form fills on our end, setting up the conversion page (typically the thank you page) as a goal. 
Sarah - can you ensure that <i>every</i> single Save TC is responded to within 12 hours?  Even those not assigned to you?
Can I get an overview of what Demolition is/how it will work?  I'm on the board but I'm not quite on that level of understanding...yet.
Jayah + Mizuni

I'm hoping for your thoughts on how they could get this type of data in Google Analytics.

Based on what they are looking for, would CallConvert be a good solution for the click trial, time on site, etc.?
DealerSocket Dev (lskin ID 441) is now set up with click to call.  Scott and Ben both have phone codes.    The link below obviously needs variables input but it's active and working.

https://ctc.dialtag.com/ctc.cfm?dial1=##########&dial2=##########&lid=441&phoneCode=####

I've asked to confirm that calls to this line actually have somewhere to go.  In other words, does this account still actually exist on their side.  I want to make sure they see that the flow of OB c2c integration into CRM is already set up and working like any other call.

That seems like a really easy piece to understand but the DS team previously couldn't grasp how on earth a c2c call could make it into CRM.  
We'll get this rolling next week for select dealers.
This is great. I'd love to have this ready in time for our pilot with Bob Moore Auto since we will be going head to head against Call Revu in hopes to win all 15 stores.

Great work!  You're pushing the right buttons!
Updating the wording to "Didn't Connect To a Qualified Agent" into three different search-able categories:
<br>
<br>
"Didn't Connect/No Message Left" 
<br>(127599) Hung up after 30+ seconds of holding 
<br>(127600) Wrong number; nobody there; hung up during bridge greeting 
<br>(127601) Caller could not connect to live, qualified agent - Other 
<br>(127604) Reached voicemail, did not leave message 
<br>(127606) Declined to leave a live message

"Left Voicemail" 
<br>(127603) Reached voicemail, left message

"Left Live Message" 
<br>(127605) Left a message with a live person
nice.  Well I'm up for a trip.   Who else is going?   Do we have the address for their office in Utah?
Good to know. I'd like to move forward with a change identical to Kelly's decision for Patient Pursuit. In case an individual needs the reasons why and hasn't referenced the PP board- I don't want there to be a discrepancy between the metrics on the Performance Report and the calls that can be found in Leadbox. The perception of our clients could be that the Performance report is inaccurate if the actual calls cannot be found. 
Hey team, 

Two quick things: (1) if you research an account and find a follow-up TC is not ideal, please cross the account of the list to save other people time

(2) Second, understand long lists like this have not been vetted, yet. Please be aware of any groups/accounts that the Consulting team has asked you refrain from calling without their approval (Crown Corporate, Hiley Huntsville, LHM, etc.) 
Yes
@Launch - attached is a list of last month's TCs that could potentially use a follow-up.

Please ensure that you:

1) verify that they have not received a TC in the past 2 weeks

2) Ensure that there is not already an open TC

3) MARK the accounts that you are calling.  Do not claim an account and then sit on it for a week before engaging.  You should plan to call he day you call the account within the day.
But if certain hproducts share the HCATs, it'll change the order for them too, right?
Nice Kelly and Josh!
Good News! 

Pat Shaughnessy at Bass Pro is interested in more info about Car Wars and a Demo! I explained to him how we help dealers get better on the phone to drive sales and revenue and he said that was something that would help them. He manages 70+ dealerships for Bass Pro and Tracker Marine.

We didn't set a specific time for a demo because he is out of town next week and i'm on vacation the week after. But, he's going to be in Round Rock, TX (North of Austin) next week. Any way we could go down there and set up lunch and a face to face meeting with him? If so, I can call him and try to set that up. 

In the meantime, he requested some info via email, I'll work with Sam to get that together. 
Awesome.  Go get 'em team.

<b>Cheri is very good at PR.  She mentioned that to me at lest 4 times.  I actually believe her though.  We should pick her brain if we want to get better at PR.</b>
Cheri went on to tell me about her earlier life.   When she was 17, she started doing crack and selling crack with her dad.  She ended up in jail six different times.  Pretty wild.  She did finally turn things around and now visits prisons to help prisoners prepare for life outside the walls. 
Cheri's first invention was a blow up, floatable, waterproof, tanning bed....

I'll let that sink in.

She said she is receiving about $700 a week in royalties because of this invention.
Looking at the database, I think the column hcat_rank can be use to sort the hcat instead using the ID. That column should allow us to change the order to what we want.
I had lunch with Cheri Garcia of Rent Eval yesterday.  And she came to our micro event this morning.

She thinks very highly of herself and thinks Rent Eval is going to make her rich.  The further I dug, the more I learned that she is a bit lost and she is still very early in the process.  On Pitch Day, the first version of Rent Eval went live.  She has 0 clients, a few people interested in piloting, and she has no idea what is going on in Multi Family.  I was trying to get her up to speed on the industry and she was very lost.  I'm going to continue to help her get into the industry.
@Phil, you're right.  A lot of their dev resources are in Utah now, including the two guys most closely associated with this build.

You're also right that this project could be built without an in-person visit.  It's a critical project though and getting a CI troop on the ground could drastically increase the turn around time on a working solution.
Jackie is right, it's order by hcatid currently. 

Did the agent ask the caller to contact him/her if anything changes on the appointment?

This only happens after booked appointments. Please call me if you need to change or cancel!


Did the agent ask for permission to call back if the caller's needs can be met at a later date?

This only happens when the person doesn't want to book. Okay, would it be alright if I called you back if we have that apartment open up before your move-in date?

Did the agent set expectations for the return call?

Great. I'll give you a call back on Thursday around noon.


Nice.  I sent over that screen shot just so we're super clear.

Phil and BP were added to the email chain by Ben with DS.  That's good to see.

Can we use bitly (url shortener) or some type of similar functionality to decrease the call url link?
Ellis does mystery calls. They ask some pretty good questions.
1) "Did the agent ask why the customer is moving"

2) "Did the agent describe community features and amenities (pool, etc)" and "apartment features", (We only have "Did the agent describe features and benefits of the property?")

3) "Did the leasing agent create a sense of urgency"

4) "Did the leasing agent offer directions or confirm the location of the community" (We have "Did the agent provide instructions on what the caller should do upon arrival?")

These are all great parts of a call. I think we should consider adding 1,2, and 4. 

3 would be much harder to judge by our human reviewers.
@Mike,

Dealersoket already has the lskin in their system under the Email/Lead Setup tab.  It's the same account number we post our leads into.
@Ed, how do we currently order the HCATs in this pod? (207)

My guess is that it's by HCAT number, and we aren't going to change the HCAT numbers. 
Test received!

Jacob had to take off the call_complete requirement so we could get a text to push through, but here you have it. 


Do we want to set call_complete to be different for text messaging? Meaning do we want to send once we have part of the qualifying hco, or wait until the whole call is complete. 





Nice.  Aside from the prizes, think outside the box on ways you can make the general competition fun.  Maybe a goofy theme.
Check the link right above there for the "How is agent CRISP score calculated" or something.

And no, because it's based completely off of phone skills. 

Because we can't measure how an agent connects calls (because every one that goes to them is obviously a live conversation with a qualified person), we rank agents based on phone skills that aid in CRISP score for dealerships.
Just got one. Here is a sample Lead Box banner

While I'm eager to help out, I'm a bit confused on the travel.   I'm willing to fly out wherever I'm needed but I don't think that being in-person for this is entirely necessary.

Also from the email chain with Ben Fuller it looks as if their dev team is in Utah, not San Clemente.

@RW, Do you want us to fly out? And if so, where are we going? lol
Now is the time, make a comment here before it goes to Jackie's team.
Yeah, that sounds like a great thing to do. Let's have some fun with the prizes.
Yes
<b>New users</b>

The DS build team will be our hero. I can bring their team up to speed on getting c2c set up during install by default. They are already are incredibly familiar with our system and DS (they are really the only DS employees who are). They also already know how to get the lskin, OB # and names of user's of whom to set it up for.


<b>Existing users</b>

This is more tricky. I can work with training their consultants or the support team on helping us set this up. Both should learn it, but the consultants might be our best bet here. What all will they need to do on their end?
So our commitment would be the cost of the prizes?
+ Justin

Question for the group:  How shall we handle the set up process for DS click to call users?  It's not too early to formulate the process in 1-3 sentences for DS to review. 

Example: Their developers who aren't quite as in tune with the complete scope of our relationship asked me about the nature of the Lskin and how it gets created.  That's a not a big deal but the sooner we can the vision of a simple set up, the better.

There are two situations:

* New users

* Existing users




So, can we do it?
<b>What does sponsorship entail?</b>

- Jbird and I would be the judges

- CI would put together the 1-3 place prizes (we could also do something for every presenter too just to help keep us sticky)
Penske West is having 2 Internet Manger's Conf this summer (June 16-17 & mid July). Each will have 20-25 stores represented. CI and AutoTrader were the only 2 vendors invited. 

We don't get much face or talk time with the actual dealers (not our choice), so I pushed Casee to see how we could get more face time to meet with the dealers while we are there. Jbird and I will be speaking on Wednesday, but other than that, the schedule is so jam packed that there will be almost no time at all for us to spend with the dealers. Casee didn't have a good answer for me.

Casee just called with an idea to help us get more face time. AutoTrader is sponsoring an event the first night (taking everyone to TopGolf). So Casee wanted to give us the opp to sponser something and get the face time that we are after. So they are having a Best Ideas Contest (every store has to present), and she wanted to know if we would like to sponsor it.

We're missing a couple things.

1) "Did the agent ask why the customer is moving"

2) "Did the agent describe community features and amenities (pool, etc)" and "apartment features", (We only have "Did the agent describe features and benefits of the property?")

3) "Did the leasing agent create a sense of urgency"

4) "Did the leasing agent offer directions or confirm the location of the community" (We have "Did the agent provide instructions on what the caller should do upon arrival?")

Overall, I think these are all important steps for a good leasing call. However, #3 would be much harder to judge by our human reviewers.
I have specific ideas in mind, so I'll take the lead on creating the projects. We'll move fast.
We're going to be very focused and very public about pushing out all summaries within 27 minutes. That's a crazy goal given our volume, but it's not impossible. 

We know from experience that the current call summary category rarely has a lag because reviewers love the payout and ease. I'm convinced we can add a lot of people to this modified version and keep pace.

We're also going to become much more aggressive about posting these summaries in front of the right people. Dealers will be fully aware of what we're doing.
A strong competitor can be a helpful force. It busts away complacency and keeps us moving. That sounds like fluff, but we've had a great week scrambling to up our game because of the pressure we're feeling from Call Revu.

Here's what I want to do:

1. Load up hcat 3 and hcat 20 for lightning-fast throughput. We're already doing pretty well there.

2. The moment a call gets marked as hcat_optionid 60 (sales opportunity), it immediately goes into a new summary category. This will be a special Car Wars summary category that's briefer than the summaries we currently provide. We'll be hyper-focused on collecting: who called, who handled, calling about, key discussion points, outcome.

3. After typing the summary, the reviewer will use our new Quick Review widget to mark the hcat 7 + beyond categories for standard reporting.

4. When we present the call data to the dealer, we'll include a very simple, unobtrusive thumbs up / thumbs down icon for 'Was this summary helpful' -- if he clicks no, we'll push the call to a mediation category for review.
I've been in communication with technical folks and received another email today with questions.

Good news: I created click to call for ABC Nissan a couple months ago as an example.  The link is great because you can switch out any variables you want.  Once people recognize that as the driver of click to call, the light bulb goes on.  The DS developer responded that click to call link worked perfectly and he understands that.

I will tackle his (typical c2c) questions and report back.
I was ticked at Call Revu for stealing the Lithia store. 

I made a lazy excuse: they're eating the cost by spending $4,000 per month for a full-time employee whose only job is to immediately review calls for this single store that's only paying $685 per month for the service. 

It's not sustainable! The dealership will come crawling back!

Last night I ran some actual numbers and realized that I've been blinded by the big numbers of our aggregate counts across thousands of stores. On an individual dealership basis, the majority of our Car Wars stores average fewer than 20 Sales Opportunity calls each day.

That's great news.
Will y'all please make sure Ryan Ledet wears a life jacket? I'm not sure he can swim. It may be best to have him in a double with a trusted adult. 
*Outlier
Here is the project where Cody outlined remaining technical tasks that I referenced in the post below.
Good news! The last round of State Farm stakeholder meetings was today and we have set a time frame for this to go-live. We are looking at the beginning of the week of June 15th so that there will be several days of it live before Jeanne's outage for surgery. 

They are very excited about this (and so am I!) so this bulletin board will be used to map out the last couple of punch list items that need to happen before it is live. 

Here are the tasks that need to happen that Cody has outlined in the attached project:

- Integrate header and page with state farm account

- Build engine to fill all calls reports as outlined below

- Enable email form (all pages)

- Add file attachment to email form (campaigns only)

- Fix more info spacing when clicking on "i" in operations and marketing.

There is also a couple items that I would like to add:

- Remove "descriptions" of the campaigns that are on the Campaign Landing page (this is placeholder text right now and may be something we add later, but SF would like to go-live without it)

- Reorder pods on Marketing and Operations pages to reflect more recently built ones at the top of the list (like we did for the cm.com platform live for them now).

I believe all of these items should be relatively quick alterations, but please let me know if that is not the case with any of them. SF does not need to see them in the test environment before it is live- they are fine with us just taking care of it.

I am reviewing our State Farm user report to identify the individuals that need to receive an email message and will handle that independently with our SF stakeholders. The tasks above I believe are all that we will need to do technically.

@Cody: can you think of anything else?

@Jayah: can we get projects rolling for the remaining items? I am fine if it is one or multiple- whatever is easiest for you all. They are not something we need to work on this week, but we will need to have them finished end of next week.

Thanks!
Sam is an outlier
<b>Who I met with?</b> Adair Neely, Assistant Director
<br>
<br>
<b>What we talked about?</b>
<br>
1. Vision for Lead Tag
<br>
2. Recruiting graduates via their training program
<br>
3. Lead Tag's ideal candidate
<br>
<br>
<b>When are they hosting another training session?</b>
<br>
<br>
They have Spring and Fall classes of 8 participants, and their next class will be held in September.
<br>
<br>
<b>Why is this a good partnership?</b>
<br>
They have similar vision of helping individuals develop, and success in life. Adair will work very closely to identify talented individuals within their organization. She has a few candidates in mind as of now, who she think may be a great fit for Lead Tag!
<br>
<br>
She also discussed her next class of individuals to come by our office to visit, and one of our agents present a success story to her group.
<br>
<br>
<b>Next Steps:</b>
<br>
Follow up with Adair on potential candidates, and also she will email me a list of other organizations that may be interested in partnering with me during my recruiting efforts.




Sale #1 about to go down already.  Single office guy I talked to last night, looking to expand, just told us to call his wife now and get him signed up w/ PP + Phone Skills.  Josh on the phone now.
I just copied Bryan and Phil to an email response to DealerSocket. It appears there are some technical people finally working on this project for DealerSocket.

I assume they're working on the desktop piece. Let's make sure it's perfect. If you need to fly to San Clemente tonight, then book your trip and go.

If they start talking about mobile, let's huddle up to clarify our approach. I've previously outlined an Affectation strategy.

Use this board to keep everyone updated.
Great.
I like that. Eliminates the excuse "I have to get approved". Jess will be back in office next week and will like this update as well.

To me, reading $1481 does look and sound a lot cheaper than $1581 since it's under $1500. Oh, psychology.
Got it. 

Testing in Showcase Honda now with Jacob and myself. 
Here are two examples:

Wait, Ryan......seriously? 
Jill, I'll provide a few examples. Give me 10-15
@Dan, Cheer Squad? Yes. This is my moment.
Is it possible to get some calls pulled for AMSI, so I can listen in from the reviewer's perspective?

I know we're struggling with cheaters in hcat 7, due to the lack of hcab. With no hcab and big contests running, we suffer from reviewers taking advantage of the category. If we straightened out the lag situation enough for hcat 7, would it be possible to run hcab requiring 3 matches rather than just 2? (We addressed a similar deal <a href="http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/bproject_manage.cfm?pid=5231">here</a>)

I know that we should push for this accuracy for all accounts, but in this instance we could require three matches based on lskin only. This way we are not drastically affecting the number of pending calls in hcat 7 again by applying the hcab settings to all calls that run through it. 
Now I'm confused. If auto-match=on and we post a call with a customer name, a source, and an attached agent, then where will it go? Would it still just dump into that same Pending Assignment list?
We are about to run into a situation where DS CM accounts are going to getting on SS without CW:

For Example: PAG - Motorwerks BMW

In may, they did ~25000 min on CM. They are not interested in CW right now, but are very interested in SS.

For stores with CW + SS, we have them on total price of CW 6k + SS and 0 overages, and once they are at 12k on CW minute, they get bumped up. This keeps us from having to manually do their bill each month. 

But in this scenario, they would be on the CM 2000 min package for all of their sales calls. How should we handle the billing piece for situations like this?
Will Do McCall!
Other Notes:

OR Portland Buick GMC - showing up same as Beaverton? 

OR Salem BMW - I just launched CW with them

OR Springfield Scion - Same as the Toyota location 
@Jackie, we had a question about CRISP Reporting. 

In the image below, were is this data pulled from? Would it be possible to have this piece of the reporting without PST?  
E-Lead accepts our phone codes, but I'm pretty confident they don't assign the call or lead based on that  XML data.

They should and it's been recommended.
Atlantic auto group said if/when they come on
I thought the phone code ID# was the big trigger for creating a new lead when auto-match=on. Is there not a way to bypass the "select an owner" screen in eLead by providing the agent who handled the call?
moved to this bulletin board
1)  It probably depends on the dealer.  If Reid handled a call from Justin who previously purchased a car from Sarah who still works at the dealership.  Who does that opportunity get assigned to?  

2)  I believe auto-match creates a new opportunity with the previous sales person that handles the lead since we only send caller ID.  They con't currently do anything with our phone code data.

We should find out from Nathan how DS handles this and then we can clarify with Jacobs.
I made a map of the locations. Hopefully the link works 
If an existing prospect does not have an Active opportunity, then we should create a new opportunity for that prospect. Correct?

If auto-create is turned on and we send in a packet with the agent owner marked, will this create a new opportunity for that existing prospect?
For reference, here is the phonedamentals questions.
Here is the information we should have on the cheat sheet.

<li> Ask for the appt
<li> All phonedamentals questions
<li> Basic contact information form fills
That should still count as an appointment request. I'll create a separate thread to straighten out that problem.
AMSI really wants credit for requesting appointments, so they're asking as soon as the customer indicates interest. That's good and should be rewarded.

Our reviewers are likely missing the request because it occurs so early in the call. What's the best way to get the reviewers properly focused?
This was my original idea and I like the concept.

If we can turn this cheat sheet into a notepad that they can use over and over again for each call, and then transcribe their notes into their lead management tool, that is a really valuable handout we have given them.
Monica and I have been told that it would be helpful for our leasing agents to have a cheat sheet of all the best practices for a perfect phone call.  Leasing teams would like to have a notepad / laminated guide that will help them complete a perfect call.  Let's get that started!
The purpose of this board is to spin up a marketing project to get started on our phone skills cheat sheet.
Side note:

What are the differences between these three phonedamental questions?

<li>Did the agent ask the caller to contact him/her if anything changes on the appointment?
<li>Did the agent ask for permission to call back if the caller's needs can be met at a later date?
<li>Did the agent set expectations for the return call?

What can we do to be more explicit in our reporting so people know exactly the scenario around each of those three?
Here is the new order.  (Top left: first, top right: second, 2nd down left: third, etc...)

<li>Did the agent identify him/herself and the property?
<li>Did the agent repeat back the caller's name at the beginning of the call?
<li>Did the agent ask at least one question about the caller's leasing preferences?
<li>Did the agent describe features and benefits of the property?
<li>Did the agent ask how the caller heard about the property?
<li>Did the agent offer at least two different times for an appointment?
<li>Did the agent provide instructions on what the caller should do upon arrival?
<li>Did the agent confirm the best call-back number for the caller?
<li>Did the agent ask the caller to contact him/her if anything changes on the appointment?
<li>Did the agent ask for permission to call back if the caller's needs can be met at a later date?
<li>Did the agent set expectations for the return call?


Jackie, I would like to discuss a small adjustment to this report.  I would like to reorganize the questions into "phonealogical order".  

Two reasons why: 

When doing a demo, I hate seeing so many 0% circles at the top. If we move it to phonealogical order, this will be fixed.  

Also, the report will make a lot more sense and will raise less questions with the change.
Here is how E-Lead structures their Leads.  Leads are called "Prospects".

Leads are called <b>Prospects</b></br>
--  Each prospect has an <b>Opportunity</b></br>
--  Each opportunity has a <b>sales status</b> (Active, New, Hot, etc).  See screenshot</br>

I think just attaching calls to opportunities that have an active status would help them clean up the phone bucket drastically.

Bonus for E-Lead t'ing up the sales person based on phone code and us entering the name of the customer.  
I have a mystery to solve.

We have been adding outbound hcats 83 and 84 to all Service Setter accounts because these are new HCATs, and we are testing them before making new summary reporting live.

However, every time I look back at SS accounts to see how the HCATs/reporting is doing, I find that these hcats are excluded from a lot of accounts again.

Has someone been manually excluding them? We can't find any cases or anything on it. 
Humanatic app cfc is now working.
This is the reason PayPal is giving as to why they no longer accept Payoneer.

I am sorry to inform you that PayPal no longer accepts Payoneer accounts to be added on any PayPal account. This is because the Payoneer account is not a bank account and therefore you would not be able to add it to your PayPal account. (Section 14. (Disclaimers), “The US Payment Service is not a bank account in the United States and funds received on your behalf are not FDIC-insured.”) as per the Payoneer US Payment Service Terms and Conditions.


Unfortunately we do not allow the use of Virtual Bank Accounts as they do not meet the “Know Your Customer” and customer protection guidelines outline in various laws and regulations such as the USA PATRIOT Act."
Anything we should copy?

FYI certificate being installed this evening
Way more in depth than I thought it would be. That's a slight advantage they have over us. 

I don't like the shopping report follow-up form, though. If the call doesn't go well, what are the odds the leasing agent is going to be totally honest in their critique and then hand it to their regional manager? Our reports are much more objective.

@McCall, since there are a lot of stores how should we approach them date wise to visit? 
Let's meet Monday to talk about what's needed when we onboard PP accounts.
There's one more, which is a banner inside a Lead Box alert. I realize this is probably the one you aren't familiar with, but we don't have an example of one yet. Sorry. 
I hear ya.  I don't think this is meant to cover a lag, but instead to get users to see reporting they can actually use to create action.  Seeing trend data on a daily basis removes the trend and deafens the user to that data.

I guess, let's have some conversations about what that wizard would look like and how it would guide them though.
I've listened to a few more. Are the reviewers listening for the idea of an appointment? Or are they listening for key words? (appointment, this morning or this afternoon, 2:15 or 3:45?)

Because, these guys say "would you like to come by for an appointment" on every call, but most of the time, the question is so early in the conversation that it doesn't work. The customers still have a question and aren't ready to just show up. 
Felix and I are checking these calls right now. We'll have some results soon.

This is great! I liked the layout too! Thanks!!!!!

			<p>I factored out the image resizing into it's own function and verified that
this works for android v5.    Now to test for v4.4 and then we should be good
to go.

Doing some test pics (NSFW (jk lol)) I noticed that the native resizing causes
cropping to occur so if a person's head is at the top or the bottom of the image
their head gets chopped off a bit.

A better UI would be to migrate the cropping mechanism to native functionality,
but that's worthy of a different project.</p>

Thanks Reid.  This is a result we saw coming.  I'm interested to see what reasons we are seeing within that category.  I have a few guesses, but I'm glad we are taking these steps to approach this in a new way.
Not posting a screenshot of direct email. It's an email sent by Hubspot with anything we want to put in it. 
LEADIM chat (this isn't complete yet, but we know what front end will be)
Kris and Frank (BDC and GM) are all over the alerts. They check and listen to a lot of them. Tony and I are now combating "inaccurate" alerts pretty frequently. A lot of these are those grey calls: Customer wanted Fiance, spoke to BDC rep about a car they have purchased. It kind of sounds like a sales call if you don't know the customer asked for F&I. 

They also appear to say "when would you be able to stop by for an appointment" almost immediately once they realize the customer is an opportunity. Are the reviewers getting the audio with the marker already past this? I have some examples of the request coming at 40 seconds. I attached one. In this one the customer ignores the request completely (this happens in lots of the exampes I've listened to), but the agent still asked. 

This is something we run into constantly w clients. Do we have a successful answer? 
Product Announcement with video (video is optional)

This seemed obvious after Sarah mentioned it. We should always go right below the big numbers ($500, $1000, $1500, $2000).

Rather than over-thinking this, I vote for an immediate reduction to $1,481 for Asbury. "Since you're already on Car Wars" provides an easy explanation for the adjustment.
The purpose of this board is to show Lauren and Miguel where all of the UCOMM tactics show up in the product. 
Lead Tag & AC's are both reaching out to stores, so lets just be strategic with who we call. This TC is a good example.
Accounts:

WA Spokane BMW<br>
WA Spokane Chevy Cadillac<br>
WA Tri-Cities CJD<br>
WA Seattle BMW

Is this correct @Hayley?
He wasn't in a good mood to start.  He called me I answered he said hold on one sec.  Then I heard him yell at somebody for like 30 seconds straight then got on the phone and said Dustin why do you want to come to our store.......
Check out the attached. It's a little different than what we need here but along the exact same lines of thinking.


With Showroom, we were trying to allow the to manage what accounts were shared into a daily file. Some of those were their own sub-accounts and some were shared mutual clients.

All this special link would need to be is a list of current lines in their account + lines shared with CARFAX via the Vendor Insert Tool.
Interesting. I've never heard of a GM saying no to a free on-site. Let me brainstorm a bit. For now, move forward with planning. I definitely think being in-store helps, just in case CallRevu were to come in. But if he specifically decline, then we have to take that into consideration as well.
Ian worked on this last summer.  It was pretty easy and this one should be even easier.

Note: I realize that I'm swerving this away from the Edmunds style report conversation but this should be a much better approach.
Today I'll load some from Tamarack Hills Dentistry to Twin Cities Dental.
I have a different idea that should be easier.  It's also already been implemented in the past.

For Showroom Logic, we used to have a simple link in their Manage numbers section that allowed them run a quick query of every single number in their account.  

That query included current numbers in the account + numbers that were shared into their daily file.  They could even manage what numbers got shared into the daily file themselves.  That's a step more than we need here but....

A link in the Admin area of CallMeasurement that provides a simple spreadsheet of all current numbers in the CARFAX account and all numbers currently shared.  It would only need to include the number plus label1, label2, and label3.
If it's a new opportunity call for an inactive customer, why wouldn't we just post it as a new lead? Would eLead scramble that into the old, inactive lead?
@Jackie

My gut is API.

The question that I would ask is how much does this capability fit into the strategic direction SH is going?  I don't know the answer to that.  If it's a fit then go for either building it or reselling it.
We'll investigate that selection in hcat 26 to ensure something meaningful isn't being lost in the [Other] option.
Since there's a timeline on this and three members of my team are out today, the new game plan is to have Andrew and Taylor contacting all of these stores.


Andrew, add these to your list:

Hendrick Lexus (21066)

Hendrick Lexus of Charleston (37804)

Hendrick Lexus Northlake (21073)



Taylor, add these to your list:

Hendrick Motors of Charlotte (21070)

Rick Hendrick BMW MINI Charleston (40287)

Rick Hendrick Chevrolet Charleston (17596)

Rick Hendrick Volvo Charleston
Patient Pursuit reason not booked:
<li>[Other / No reason given]</li>

This option is being selected 53% of the time. That's way too high.

We've accomplished our primary goal of bringing down the lag. Now it's time to look at the Other selections and decide if there's anything in there we care about.

Jamal, please tee up Felix to go through the attached list of recent calls and mark the reason why the appointment was not booked. All of these calls were marked as [Other / No reason given].
@Hayley, do I need to contact Hendrick BMW? Looks like you already talked to the GM about ICDC in <a href="http://go.centuryinteractive.com/go/account_event.cfm?lid=21067&gid=25493">this TC</a>
Well then that would change the scope of what the report looks like since it relies mainly on Humanatic data a lot of it would need to get cut out. 

What matters for them in the example Edmunds report that we could still use/report on?

We could make the report call measurement compatible. 
Yes, let's wait until after we talk with them.

Patient Pursuit reason not booked:
<li>[Other / No reason given]</li>

This option is being selected 53% of the time. That's way too high.
back story
Yes, I would imagine it would just be an addition in /platform_a/manage.cfm and then ideally it would ingest, and perform the function. 

Should we wait pending your call today before moving forward?

			<p>So I went back to the last revision on the v5 branch and noticed that it set
the mPictureFilePath (v5's equivalent of self.file_path) to "file:/path/to/file"
rather than just "/path/to/file"  It would then strip away the first five
characters everywhere it needed to for the image manipulation but kept it
when creating the Uri object to pass to the ValueCallback.  As it turned out,
this was the reason my thing wasn't working.   The Uri object wanted something
of the form "file:/path/to/file" so simply pasing "file:" + this.file_path made
it behave as I anticipated.

In testing I came across the same issue where pressing the back button in the
camera app caused the form items to not be clickable anymore, so I added the
else call onReceiveValue(null) clause.

In chats with MattP we're in agreement that we won't need the conditional for
the case where the intent parameter called data is not null</p>

Correct.  Enter a line for deactivation or upload a file.  We will tell them exactly what needs to be in the file.

Same goes for requesting the provisioning a of a line.

We have a conversation this morning with CARFAX.  We're going to learn as much as possible about their processes and report back. 

A quick question that I would hope to relay to them this morning:  Could we add a link of this nature to their CallMeasurement.com account?  Similar to what we did with DealerSocket for Launching accounts.  
He knew who I was.  He said yeah we use car wars every day and we are doing great.  Why do you need to come and do training when we already know how to use your product. 

Did he mention another week that would work? What was your VM?

I would suggest not leaving VM's if you can.

I also heard from someone else that the dealership thought they were selling something. Remember to stick to a this script:

Just make sure to say right when you get them on the phone that you are calling from Lithia's current call tracking service and that they currently have an account with us. You can let them know that we are actively trying to make sure they are engaged and getting the most use out of the platform, so we want to do an in-store visit. That way they want to meet with you and don't think you are selling them anything (which you can do while you are there). 

Remember to drop Randy Sparks name. Tell them that you work closely with him and that he thought a meeting would be beneficial for them to see how our platform can help their dealership.
Ryan -- GM's need to be reached by today or tomorrow. By EOD Friday, just let me know who we have and have not reached. I will send all of them follow-up emails.
I'm just gonna leave this here
Mike reading your comment from  Tuesday, June 2 at 5:43 PM. 

Dropdown with Deactivate a phone or Request a phone number

If deactivate, provide a field for the number. Include a note that this number will no longer carry phone traffic.

If provision, include a field for the ring to, label1, label2, and label3. We will customize these label fields since every single of their numbers are the exact same.



On both pieces I'd assume that we would want both single and bulk functionality?</br>
Outside of that I think this should be a straight up page for deactivation or provisioning of lines. 
Loading from Smile Design - Citrus Park to Smile Desgin - West Chase.
They don't use humanatic data, so it would just show call counts.  

Also, Jayah, would they be able to view this pod in Call Measurement? 
<b>Call For Inactive customer:</b>  We could certainly put an indicator in our XML share packet.  It would still be up to E-Lead to reactivate that lead.  This is where the <i>appointment shown</i> and <i>customer sold</i> may help us.  

<b>Sending as "New" lead:</b> Under the current scenario it would require a merge/match from E-Lead.

  


From Pearland Family Dentistry, Up to Pleasant Plains Dental.
ICDC has been turned on.

Updated contacts: As far as GM changes, Tom Ditzig is Executive GM over the BMW, Mini, and Volvo stores in Charleston.  Chris Blocker took over Tom’s previous GM role at Hendrick BMW Northlake. 

All other GM's in the contacts should be up to date.
Does it seem like they do this by some algorithm or keyword scan?
I tried to reenable auto_authenticate_humanatic.cfc, given that the Car Wars app is now working, but it's still messing up. The only thing I can think of is that CF isn't extending the CFC properly.
I'm not sure where/how CARFAX numbers are identified but I would imagine once that is determined it would be fairly easy to make another version for them. 

It would be an exact copy of the report?
@Hayley,

Is ICDC turned on already for these accounts?
Thumbs up. Thank you Mitchell for all you do. 
Obviously, each store is a different TC. Let me or Hayley know if you have any questions!
Same study found that 80% of consumers reverse a purchasing decision after reading a negative review.

I've tried reaching out to support for each of the three you listed.  No responses.

I don't immediately see any ability to import or export calendars from any of these softwares.


That said, options 1 and 2 look like the best bets for the foreseeable future.  In fact, option 2 looks like a really really good solution IMO.

Option 3 has multiple, tough hurdles.  For example, we haven't made any inroads with the Dentrix API yet (Easy Dental = Dentrix).  API is key to unlocking this.  I think we will crack the code eventually but we're many months away from having a solution ready for you to use.

I know this isn't the news you were hoping for but that's our reality today.
I have a report set up currently for myself. Its a call alert with enable_sms = 1 and my phone number as the axreport_recipient::recipient value. I believe there are already some reports in the queue ready to be sent out. We just need to run the processes manually and see what happens.

@Lauren We are good to go with whatever you need us to do. We have training 9-12 and then from 2-3 today
I left this one for a few days. I don't think I'm completely for this. It seems like a disservice to our clients to take away an option to cover up our lag. We've had a lot of requests about hiding or changing reporting because of lag, and I don't think it's the right solution. 

Inevitably, we're going to create onboarding for Patient Pursuit. I probably need to get started because it's on my goals for this quarter. Probably in wizard form. It's a better idea to have him guide users to the most ideal reporting. We can have him guide them towards creating a weekly PPR instead of a daily one. Yes, they can still create a daily one if they want, but that's not what we will guide them to.

It will vary by group.  Some may require a Market Area VP to approve (Hendrick) -- if a GM wants something though advocating it to corporate is our best way of getting corporate approval.  If a store wants something... generally, they'll find a way to jump through hoops like that.  

Some allow GMs to have sole discretion.  (You may see their pay is influenced by whether or not they stay at or under a certain budget)

Do you know whom approves the SS agreements for Asbury?  Is it Ion?

Good morning!


The date for our Marketing, Learning, and Pricing Summer Session is drawing near! Below are a few details to help you prepare for your trip to Chi-Town in July!


1. Pack Sunglasses. I'm hoping for warm and sunny weather!


2. Our host location is Hotel Palomar Chicago. 


3. If you have received hotel stay confirmation numbers from me, I received reservation requests from you. If I did not and you would like for me to make your reservation, I can check with the hotel to see if you can receive the lower, LPC-rate. 


4. The Supplier Speed Chat event is on the morning of Thursday, July 16th, and will be held in the Contemporary Room.  The Contemporary Room will be open and ready for you by 9am that morning.  We will have a continental breakfast in that room for you while you are getting ready for the session.


Each supplier will have their own, dressed table, and chairs. We will have your table assignments to you prior to the event but will also have each table labeled with company names.
Since you will be sitting during the sessions, there is no need to bring a large trade show display, however, it is up to you on how you want to dress up the table and your area!


5. The LPC teams will come into the Contemporary Room at approximately 10am and the speed chat should start around 10:15am. We are still determining the length of time that will be taken at each table...stay tuned!


6. At the conclusion of the speed chat, we will have lunch served in the room around 12:30pm. At this point, you will get to spend a little more time with our team members!


7. The event wraps up at 1:30pm sharp! 


We are so excited to share in this event with you and hope you have a great time! Cheers to new partnerships!


If you have any questions, please let me know. Have a great day!
Here are two Ellis scoresheets.  We could learn from them.  Thanks Matt for getting this.

I don't even know how many teams are in the Big 12 guys don't tag me in football BBs
We do provide conversion data - form fill or phone calls.
Click trail is phasing out. See <a href="hproject_manage.cfm?pid=3181" target="blank">this project</a>
My echo arrived today.  Thus far I am (surprisingly) impressed.  Perhaps they configured "Alexa" to understand southern... something Siri is not fluent in.  She easily plays music from artists I've requested, tells me what time it is, what the weather forecast is in Phoenix (I'll be there tomorrow) and other random questions.  I think I'll be quite obsessed.
Count me in!  I will go ahead and reserve mine as well - excited!
One more interesting discussion was the sharing (of a portion) of a recently concluded study by their new director of research team (David Bard) who was with Forrester research (fairly well regarded technology research co based right here in Dallas).   

It appears that the home services market's well represented here (but not sure)
550 total merchants interviewed, now sure what the distro was by business type, lots of retailers and restaurants represented here.
  
Info shared was heavy on the use of social media, areas where local businesses need the most help. Very interesting info from slide 12 that I'll include right up front.. see the LOW % of local businesses that are using call tracking.. (4%)

Good general info.  <br>

@Matt, may be worth the $500 to buy it.  I'm sure that Laura might even give it to us if we decide to do something with them.. let's disucss...

I attended an local marketing conference in San Francisco yesterday put on by Street Fight Magazine.  Pretty interesting event overall.  Primary focus - local marketing trends, opportunities.  Wide range of speakers and topics:<br>
-- Banjo CEO talking about their take on how to make data more accessible and actionable (they aggregate data/images from social feeds).  Their new product = "crystal ball."  just raised $100M.. crazy. <br>
-- Google there talking about their programs to help businesses (especially automotive ones) to claim more marketing co-op from manufacturers for digital market.<br>
-- Yelp, talkin' reviews, and their plans to adding booking appointments, reservations for their clients.  Claim their site gets 140M MUV's, crazy.<br>
-- Local Biz trends (Steve Jacobs, one of SF's reporters). Interesting talk about how most of the changes in commerce are behind the scenes with all of the mind boggling amounts of info that retailers can get.  In spite of this, little relative change on the physical make up of retail.<br>
** Panel with Matt Williams, CEO of Pro.com and Marco Zappacosta (CEO of Thumbtack).  Real interesting. Two smart guys.  Of note..<br>
Thumbtack has 1,000+ unique categories of services on their site (where they do their best to match consumers and service providers)<br>
Key issues for them to solve for the consumer.. Price (getting one), Trust and Transparency.<br>
On Google, neither is worried about them per se given the operational details that need to be solved as a "portal" in this business.  View Goog as GREAT doing things that are more "programmatic" in their approach, and getting consumers and service providers connected requires getting the details right, e.g. and making sure that there's enough info there for the consumer to trust that they should invite that service provider into their home.  They both invest A LOT to filter, screen and quality contractors, and doubt the Google will sweat the details.<br>
On Amazon... Matt commented that the AMZN approach which is focused on buying a physical product (e.g. windows) AND the service at the same time only happens ~5% of the time. This surprised me.  Both Pro.com and Thumbtack are ALL about the services aspect of the business, with no focus on selling a product / good and the service.  Attaching summary of their discussion from this morning's SFSW conference below.
Additional notes:

Ash mentioned they were paying around $680/month for a certain amount of minutes to be reviewed. They review every call until they hit that mark. Once they hit the maximum amount of minutes, they email Ash and ask if he would like them to stop reviewing, or for him to pay overages to continue getting alerts. He has not yet encountered that situation, but mentioned he would pay overages to keep getting alerts within minutes to save deals.

He said that if we ever decrease our review time or come out with new features, to let him know and that he would always keep us in his back pocket as well, if CallRevu fails to deliver as promised.
Update on our trip:

We were unable to save the CA Fresno Nissan/Hyundai account. Ash, the GM likes that CallRevu gives him missed opportunity alerts & call summaries within minutes of the calls happening.

For the CA Clovis Nissan account, we talk to the GM, and showed the GSM Car Wars. The GSM liked our integration with ADP and outbound calling reporting. They want another day to make their decision.

Currently both stores are getting alerts from CallRevu within minutes. At the end of each day they also receive a report of all the calls, which department they were for, how many appointments were set, and how many opportunities are still "open." They are able to track if someone is calling back missed opportunities. If someone calls the opportunity back, they will mark it as a "closed" phone up.

Other than these three stores, we have had some great meetings and had a couple of up-sells.
You can create it in the Lithia master account.
Since I will be at the Dallas location tomorrow, please add your thoughts to this board after your conversation with Dan.

We're in the middle of negotiations and this is a crucial piece I need to relay to the client.   
Thank you all!
Okay, I have responded to her with the 14th as the visit date. Please mark that on your calendars.

I post details about where we should be flying or staying soon.
How about Wednesday at 3pm or Tuesday or 10 or 11am?  PE and I are both free those times and they appear to fit in everyone's schedule.

When you schedule and create the join.me, be sure to include PE, Jackie, Jian, me, you, and Nathan.

We must at least have Jian, Jackie, me and you and hopefully PE or Nathan.

What's the best way about building a test scenario with what we have in place currently?
One Igniter Q2 goal is to sell 5 Asbury stores on SS. Asbury contacts have told Jess they have to get purchases over $1500 approved, which adds a layer of bureaucracy. We know this means less likelihood of getting a contract and certainly delays the process.<br>

Are we shooting ourselves in the foot by charging $1581 for SS?<br>

Is this something unique to Asbury?<br>

If other groups operate this way, what is their magic number? At what $$ do stores have to get approval to buy?<br>

Is anyone running into this as a challenge?



lets discuss tomorrow when I'm in south dallas
Correct.

Project - Phone code page remove vulnerability
Project - Dialer Page remove vulnerability
3 vulnerabilities found in the XSS check. 

Follow up projects are coming up. 
Yes -- that's brilliant! I hadn't even considered that a lead status would be updated beyond Active / Does not exist.
Sounds good Hayley. I can make a TC project tonight and start assigning out. What account should I create the Consulting Project event in?
Thanks. We'll move forward. 
6c.  Reid sneakily asks them to include "sold" status in the web service pull.  ;)
Contacts in account profiles should be fairly up to date.

Can your team do TC's to reach out to each of the GM's at these stores to make sure they are aware of ICDC and what changes we are making/how this will help get calls claimed?

Lead tag will contact all BDR's, team leads, as well as store level contacts such as sales managers and staff members.

@Cam -- remember that each BDR is part of a franchise team. So Megan Blalock is the team lead for all BMW & Mini teams -- she only needs one call to be trained, not one for each store.
From prior conversations with Infusionsoft (it's been years), this wasn't a capability. These guys were also total turds and insisted on a big integration fee for the privilege of using the API.

Jian, will you dig around on the Infusionsoft site and see if you can find anything that looks promising?
3b. That's acceptable collateral damage. I imagine it's increasingly rare.

5. The additional lead status check is a good idea. That would be easy. 
These numbers look good, Cody- thanks!
Loaded a call from each of these Mansfield Dental Center, Mid Cities Dental, Miss-Lou Dental- Ferriday, Natick Gentle Dental, and Oak Heights Dental. 
Updated query specifically limited to 6/1 and 6/2:

group by label2<br>
order by label2
</pre>
@Monica - what's the deal yo?  I thought you were getting in on this? :)
YES!  Please do this.  We have already hit this very objection from clients (and understandably so!)
3b.  Unavoidable scenario:  An active customer calls from a different phone number.  (Reid uses his wife's cell phone, but provides another number on the call)  This will require a merge.  

5b. Right before we send the share, we would likely want to do another lookup in E-Lead to make sure the lead hasn't been entered during the 60 minute time frame while we reviewed the call.
