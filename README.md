Data Mining for Friday Wrap
=======

I am using <a href="https://github.com/iandfitzpatrick/pollitt">pollitt</a> for the analysis of this data. It was developed by <a href="http://www.winding.co">Ian Fitzpatrick</a> in August 2014, and released for the <a href="http://www.planningness.com">2014 Planning-ness conference</a> in Portland, Oregon.  It is an open-source library for identifying and rendering outliers and anomalies in data sets — designed for use with Google documents and libraries.

<h4>My Use</h4>
Analyze employee data for quick introduction to data mining. 
<ul>
<li>The scale and frequency of values within columns/variables</li>
<li>Correlation between columns/variables</li>
<li>Variables/columns that significantly overindex or underindex within a population</li>
<li>Most-typical, least typical, and key outlier records in a data set</li>
</ul>


<h4>Deployment</h4>
I am using a vbs scipt to crawl sql data in the data folder.
